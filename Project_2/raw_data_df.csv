R20IRE5X6WY351,B08528YFM2,5.0 out of 5 stars Great headphones!,Talia Calazans,5,"I love these headphones, and I wear them all the time. They are pretty comfortable and also very cute. They are not too bulky. The noise cancelling is not great at cancelling voices, it really just cancels out background hums, which was a bit frustrating, but does well enough on things like planes. Other than that the sound is pretty good (as someone who does not care much about super high quality sound so I'm pleased with not bad). Battery is good, will last me a few days of pretty extensive use. Bought these on sale for $70 and it was increadibly worth it for this price.","Reviewed in the United States June 1, 2024",AG6TODKB7VQYDH7KJ2MKHF6RQEGA,True,7,Color: Shadow GraySet: Studio3
RFGOLBEISEB55,B08528YFM2,5.0 out of 5 stars Great Headphones!,Leosha Williams,5,"These headphones are absolutely amazing! The volume, how they fit, the price, all top tier! I was stuck between these and the solo 3’s. I did my research and saw that the Solo 3’s can get uncomfortable after a while and that they don’t have noise cancellation. So I switched my focus onto the studios, and I'm glad that I did. The quality of these headphones is phenomenal! The bass sounds great. The headphones already drown outside noise out, but then when you cut the Actuve noise cancellation on, it’s like you’re in the world alone. I really couldn’t hear anything. Another plus is the fact that I have 21 days to add AppleCare+ to them. All of my products are protected with Applecare+ and this one will be as well. I definitely recommend these headphones if you’re looking for a great pair with noise cancellation and great studio sound! 10/10!","Reviewed in the United States June 1, 2024",AFBT2YGFVT6CBITOKGANUEJ5WYHA,True,8,Color: Shadow GraySet: Studio3

There are a lot of different headphones you can buy, but as far as over the ear headphones these are great. Very light, get a little discomfort after long use, but not bad at all. Sound is great quality especially for the gym which is my main use for these. Just be sure to wash the ear pads if you do this. Comes with an aux cord as well incase you need to hook them up differently than Bluetooth.","Reviewed in the United States June 18, 2024",AGONEWJIIDADSFNMIJQESOKWVG3A,True,1,Color: Matte BlackSet: Studio3

R2AGD67A8P04AC,B08528YFM2,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great headphones, just don't fit my big ears.",Jacob,4,"Jan 2023 - First, I am not an audiophile. So, this review will not be super technical, just an average Joe who doesn't mind paying for quality products.I did quite a bit of research before buying my next set of headphones. I read tons of reviews on Amazon and the web. I read multiple ""review/ratings"" articles online that compared numerous headphones. Ultimately, I decided to buy these because I have an iPhone and AppleTV that they work seamlessly with, and they were always rated highly at their price point.I've used them for about 2 months now. They were simple to pair with my iPhone. When I am in my living room with my AppleTV on and I turn them on, my AppleTV asks me if I want to pair them, and they have done that easily every single time. I love this seamless functionality.I use them at work primarily. I work in office with 20+ cubes. I use them often simply for the noise-canceling to stay focused, and I use them just as often to listen to podcasts and music. When in noise-canceling mode, they do not remove 100% of every sound around you. No headphones can (that I am aware of). But, they do a great job creating a virtually noise free environment with a light ""white noise"" in the background (similar to a fan in the distance). You can turn noise-canceling off, and then the noises around you are simply muffled (if you're not actively playing something on the device you're connected to).As mentioned previously, I listen to podcasts, music, and watch TV and movies with these. I think they sound fantastic with all of these. Occasionally, they do sound just a tiny bit bass-heavy for some of the music I listen to or during movies with high-action scenes that have a lot of explosions, but that's just me I guess. Some people probably prefer that with the music/media they have.My one peeve is that they don't completely fit over my ears. The good news is the cushions on the earcups are super soft. So, I can still wear them comfortably... for hours. This doesn't seem to affect the noise-canceling at all.Lastly, they seem to have a really good battery life with my usage style. I use them for varying lengths of time. At work, it's not uncommon to get interrupted and need to turn them off after 5-10 mins because I need to step away from my desk, and sometimes I will have them on for 2+ hours. At home, I often use them at night to watch stuff on my AppleTV so that I don't take a chance of waking up my kids while they are sleeping, and I can get hours of watch time in without needing to charge them (as long as they weren't close to being dead already).If you can get them on sale (like I did: $170), I wouldn't hesitate to buy them, and I saw them on sale a lot (but the sale price varied quite a bit) leading up to my purchase. I don't even think their regular price is all that bad for what you get.","Reviewed in the United States January 23, 2023",AH3SC2BAKM6AA7XJMTJ4KAET6MSQ,True,91,Color: Matte BlackSet: Studio3
R1UVTRVZ4F5DME,B08528YFM2,5.0 out of 5 stars LONG battery life.,Julian,5,"I recently invested in the Beats Studio3 Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones, and the experience has been nothing short of exceptional. These headphones effortlessly blend style, comfort, and cutting-edge technology, creating a remarkable auditory journey for music lovers and audiophiles alike.The standout feature of the Beats Studio3 is its impressive noise-canceling capability. The headphones effectively block out external sounds, providing an immersive and uninterrupted listening experience. Whether I'm in a noisy commute, a bustling café, or even on an airplane, the noise-canceling feature allows me to escape into my music without being disturbed by the outside world.Comfort is paramount during prolonged use, and the Beats Studio3 excels in this aspect. The over-ear design, combined with plush ear cushions, ensures a snug fit without causing discomfort or pressure. The headphones are lightweight, making them ideal for extended listening sessions without causing fatigue. The adjustable headband allows for a customized fit, ensuring a secure and comfortable feel.The sound quality of the Beats Studio3 is exceptional. The headphones deliver a robust and well-balanced audio experience, with crisp highs, rich mids, and powerful lows. The bass response, a signature of the Beats brand, adds depth to the music without overpowering other frequencies. Whether I'm listening to energetic beats or soothing melodies, the audio reproduction is consistently impressive.The integration of Apple's W1 chip enhances the overall user experience. The seamless pairing process with Apple devices is a breeze, and the Class 1 Bluetooth connectivity provides a stable and reliable connection. The efficiency of the W1 chip also contributes to an extended battery life, allowing for up to 22 hours of playback on a single charge.The on-ear controls add a layer of convenience to the user experience. Adjusting volume, skipping tracks, and managing calls can be done effortlessly with intuitive controls located on the ear cups. The incorporation of Siri support allows for hands-free control, adding an extra layer of functionality.The durability and build quality of the Beats Studio3 are commendable. The premium materials used in construction give the headphones a sleek and sophisticated look, while also ensuring resilience to everyday wear and tear. The foldable design and included carrying case enhance portability, making them a practical choice for on-the-go lifestyles.","Reviewed in the United States March 3, 2024",AHUVU5TLJQFQMZKFR7YKDB55USPA,True,22,Color: Midnight BlackSet: Studio3
R1SMSYH9JKNH51,B08528YFM2,"5.0 out of 5 stars Impressive Sound Quality, but Lacking in Bass",prashant naik,5,"The Beats Studio headphones deliver impressive sound quality overall, with clear highs and detailed mids. However, I found them to be lacking in bass compared to other headphones in this price range. While the sound is well-balanced, bass enthusiasts may find it underwhelming. Despite this drawback, the headphones are comfortable to wear for extended periods, with excellent noise isolation. If you prioritize balanced sound over heavy bass, these headphones are worth considering. Four stars.","Reviewed in the United States May 16, 2024",AF7TF3C7U74FMUFC2FGM6GTADYMA,True,4,Color: Midnight BlackSet: Studio3
R1H100TYFQZJLK,B08528YFM2,2.0 out of 5 stars Please Read Before Buying.,O.Winnie Mittelberger,2,"My rating falls close to a 1.5 for multiple reasons:For starters, this headphone is marketed and sold as an ANC (Active Noise Cancelling), Over-Ear headphone. Typically, headphones like these are targeting people who buy them for travel (i.e. a plane ride) but also are helpful in any public space. Please keep this in mind for the rest of my comment. From the inside out, these headphones cannot hold their own with any other pair in the price range.I purchased my pair when they were 57% off, bringing the total from $350 to $160 (including tax), but I cannot in good conscious recommend them for either price bracket. Comparing them to the most common headphone in the $350 bracket, the Sony XM4 (and newly the XM5) are a essentially the opposite side of the spectrum when it comes to all qualities. They clearly lose the battle for acceptable headphones to buy for $350, but some could make a case for the discounted price.Everything I found wrong with the Beats (most to least important):- Sound quality is mediocre.I attribute this to the old design (nearing 3 years) and old parts (Apples W1 chip is long outclassed by the newest chips)With that said, I am also no audiophile (someone who has a keen skill/desire for high quality sound) but I can make general observations about the sound quality from the Studio3's. I can't give an super detailed review of the sound quality because I only listened to ~3 songs and maybe 2 videos. But I can say is the trope that ""Beats just overbass their headphones"" isn't true. I can't say what you find as a proper balance of bass, but to me it seemed fined and not too far one way or the other. But you can tell that the timbre wasn't all that it could be. For the MSRP listed, this should not be case, even for an old design that was adopted and revamped by Apple.- ANC, one of the primary marketing points, is horrible.This is comes from a variety of reasons other than just poor build quality, after reading into the making of the Studio 3's, Beats tried making an early ""adaptive"" ANC by changing the way sound is measured, processed, and then cancelled.However, it fails completely and everything from your fingertips rubbing together at arms length, to a pencil dropping behind a closed door is essentially the same with/without ANC on.The only different is bass is slightly toned down, you don't feel like constantly pressure that other ANC headphones give (kinda like you're in an airplane at max altitude), but you hear a slight ""woosh"" constantly.- As mentioned before, build quality as a whole is terrible.Straight out the box, the right earcup is crumpled a towards the bottom because of a poorly designed folding mechanism that squishes the earcup against the headband as it's packed into the case. The earcups themselves have this cheap, fake leather look and feel, the stitching is far apart and looks poorly made, the earcup foam is obviously cheap, it easily compresses (therefore there's a lot of air) but then refills as if the foam itself isn't compact but just large pockets of air (meaning the foam itself is low quality), and the size of the earcups is very small for over-the-ear headphones. So if you happen to be ok with everything I mention, having medium-big ears will already make the experience impossible to begin with.The top headband, a common weakpoint that's overlooked in headphone design, has literally no cushioning.They didn't even use the foam from the earcups, it's rubber on the outside (when slightly damp or if it just came off someone's head) feels comparable to a pencil eraser. There is a little give to the headband but the material underneath is too thin for me to discern from just pushing down.After wearing the headphones, straight from the box, you could start ""feeling"" the headband begin pressing into your head after ~1 hour, then feel that annoying soreness after ~1.5 hours of total listening. Once again, considering travel or just extended use would be expected of a $350 headphone, there were too many bad choice they let slide.With the buttons provided on the headphone, there is one good but a few bad things.Firstly, Beats Studio3 happen to be one of the few headphones in this bracket that have a distinct power button. But the action button and touch pad are the main concern I found.A lot of online reviews will say the action button (the beats logo) feels cheap and totally disrupts the hearing experience, but I can't say I completely agree. I do like a tactile button, but the button provided has a distinct and somewhat loud click. It doesn't inherently sound cheap nor satisfying to me, but that's partly subjective. However, you can hear the click very clearly when you are wearing them so if that's something you dislike, and you'd prefer a touchpad then be aware of that.One of my most concerning observations for the build was the Micro USB charger in the headphones. A lot of online reviewers bash on the cable that's provided to charge the Studio3 pair, but I don't mind that they were able to pack some ginormous cable because I can plug in the USB A into a nearby port for close charging. However, the choice for Micro USB charging as a whole is a bad idea to me. Micro USB is getting very old now, being outshined by Lighting and USB C when it comes to things like charging speed, data transfer speed, etc. But my main concern is durability. Again, a $350 pair of headphones should essentially guarantee you multiple years of use. I didn't fully test the battery life of the pair, but over my years of use with Micro USB I know that the cable itself can corrode but most importantly if the input port (like the one that built into the headphones) doesn't have good glue to hold it to the plastic inside of the earcup, then the port can pop out can render the charging useless. In the first example of the cable breaking with time, I'm sure a lot of people have old Micro USB cables laying around, but if the input port falls out, then you will be forced to use the provided AUX cord for the headphones (can't listen to portless devices like modern iPhones).- All the other complaints were at least somewhat merited regarding an expensive headphone. But this one is mostly based on aesthetic.Of these entirely subjective points, the most relatable would be the bulky carrying case the headphones come in. It's very wide and rounded, so it definitely won't sit in a backpack or carry-on without taking up unnecessary space. But if the case was designed to be wider/longer but slimmer (like the Sony XM4's) it could slide into thinner pockets without stretching out the bag. Also, forcing the headphones into a smaller but thicker case is what causes that earcup compression problem I mentioned earlier.The scale of the headphones looks off. From product pictures to models wearing them, the headphones look really nice and stylish. I bought the matte black pair, and I was excited to see how they looked. But they pair overall seems smaller than what you expected (like how I briefly mentioned the small earcups). The overall look seems like it could only give that proper ""Beats"" look on certain people with specific head sizes/shapes.If you happen to find this pair on sale, don't really care too much about noise cancelling, want a listening experience that is good but you don't mind if it isn't groundbreaking, but want a pair of headphones for more of the luxury aspect, then it wouldn't seem like a bad deal to buy these.","Reviewed in the United States December 29, 2022",AH46ZHN22ZKGHWOM3UMMORBATP2Q,True,928,Color: Matte BlackSet: Studio3

But when I saw this Beats item for $168, I decided to take a chance since this was a lot lower price for Beats headphones than I had ever seen. I was blown away by the sound and noise cancellation of this unit over my previous units. When you don’t have anything playing on them, the noise cancellation is on a par with my previous units, but when you use them for music or a phone call you are COMPLETELY isolated. I am now a believer in Beats. I have drank the kool-aid.

RF2TYMPI9P6HY,B08528YFM2,4.0 out of 5 stars great headphones but probably not the most durable,Florin,4,"long-time beats user, this is the fourth pair i've had to buy. i wear them almost all day every day and have two pairs at a time so i can switch them out. partially for noise reduction as i have auditory sensitivity issues, and they work pretty well in that regard, at least at first, and partially for music. they last me usually two years before breaking or not working anymore, often within a month of the repair/replace warranty thing running out. one pair stopped working entirely, the sound just didn't work and one side of the size adjusting mechanism (which i never use) broke completely and i had to reattach with tape. the adjusting mechanism breaking happened with another pair as well, that pair still works sound-wise, though not as well. the battery, sound, and noise reduction quality begin to decrease after about a year in my experience, not sure how this compares to other brands. i've also had to replace the ear pads on a few because they get kinda shredded after two years of use. i should probably try other headphones but change is hard so i guess beats have a begrudgingly loyal customer in me.","Reviewed in the United States April 21, 2024",AELWQVTIVXHBNYPDPTWVWD2KNPQQ,True,1,Color: Matte BlackSet: Studio3

R2GCZUGFSPN9GD,B08528YFM2,4.0 out of 5 stars Decent if you get them on sale,Derek Shoff,4,"I’ll start by saying that these are not worth the retail price of $350. But they often go on sale for around $170 which Is where they need to be priced at for the quality of sound you get. I ordered the grey with gold trim because they were the only ones on sale when I was in the market, which I do love th my is color but I really wanted the red ones. Which are now also on sale for the same price as the grey one. Added that into this review just to let you know if there is a certain color you want just be patient they will go on sale. Now with all that said a big part of the reason I bought these was the noise cancellation feature which is a joke. I have a $50 pair of over the ear onns that do a way better job of noise canceling than these do.so if you are buying for that feature alone I strongly advise you to look elsewhere. The sound quality is decent. It does not compare to a good pair of Bose but you will be paying double for a pair of Bose. As long as you get these on sale for $170 or less I think you’ll be happy with the purchase. The bass is a little disappointing I really expected it to thump from Beats by Dre. It is there you can hear it but it’s not great. The fact that these are Apple compatible was a big reason I bought them I can pair them and talk effortlessly when I get a phone call without ever taking my phone out of my pocket. The microphone is by no means great but the caller should be able to understand you as long as you speak loudly and clearly. If the overall look is something important to you than I imagine that’s why your shopping beats in the first place because they definitely look better than all of their competitors headphones. I will end this review with another huge reason as to why I settled on them personally and maybe you will to. These are built for people with smaller heads. I really wanted a good pair of headphones to work out in, that would stay on my head nice and tight and I knew from the reviews I read before buying that these would do just that. I imagine they can get a little uncomfortable for people with bigger heads because they do sit tight but they are perfect for me.","Reviewed in the United States July 12, 2023",AE3XXREQ27I334BJK2CTMG4A6UNA,True,55,Color: Shadow GraySet: Studio3

He wears them all the time, playing games, talking to his friends, listening to music etc. However, he just informed me the one of the speakers has a static sounds in it when the noise cancelation is on. I looked on the internet and it appears this is a major issue for Beats headphones and there is no way to fix it. Normally, I would say well sometimes things break. However, this is the second pair of Beats noise canceling headphones my son has had with the exact same issue. The first pair lasted a little longer, but he bought those with his own money. These headphone are too expensive to be breaking all the time. I expect better quality control from an expensive set of headphone. I will not be buying another pair of Beats headphones ever!

RNKST26GTRHD4,B08528YFM2,"4.0 out of 5 stars Solid ANC heaphones, at the right price",Mike Jankowski,4,"Update 9/17/2022: After I wrote the review I found that on Android there are EQ apps that will help tune headphones to help them sound better. I personally use Wavelet now and with that these do sound really good now and clear up some of my criticisms about the sound in the original review. That being said, I can't find anything similar for iOS, so keep that in mind!I'll mention first that I didn't buy these headphones at full price, or anything close to it. At their original MSRP ($350) look elsewhere and don't look back, these get blown away by Sony and Bose and others at that price point. Once you get down to about $200 though? These start to look more tempting.I already have a pair of Audio Technica ATH-M50x's which have amazing sound, but no ANC, so they're great for around the house, but I needed a pair with ANC for work travel, so I took a chance on the Beats on a sale, and at a sale price, I'm pretty happy with them.The sound isn't bad, I know I've heard other people say there isn't a whole lot of bass. It does seem like that varies heavily from song to song, some give a nice, but never muddy, thump, others do feel a little lacking. Highs are pretty nice and crisp and come through well, it's the mids on these headphones that tend to be a bit muddled. It's by no means bad, but I'm also comparing it to some pretty good can headphones in roughly the same price range and the Audio Technica's win hands down there.ANC is probably the best feature of the headphones. It does a great job of keeping out engine noise when flying. Sony and Bose will do better at the Beats original price point, but at a sale price they do a very good job. You will run into a few weird quirks of it, for example I could hear it fighting the noise of a rough road while on a rental car shuttle which made for an interesting effect, but largely it just works and keeps out the noise well.Battery life seems to be pretty much what they're rated for, so no complaints there and the build quality seems solid. When using the controls, you will hear a clicking sound from the press, which I know some people have criticized. But, despite that, the controls are easy and intuitive. The look of them is pretty nice as well, but it would be nice if the ear cups to rotate to be flat on your chest, but that's a minor nitpick.Finally, the great irony, these actually seem to work better on my personal Pixel phone than my work iPhone, despite being an Apple product. The Android Beats app allows for better control of the headphones and the ANC, not to mention actually giving you a battery percentage as opposed to just a circle that gives you an approximate value. And with the Beats app installed, the pairing process was just as easy on my Pixel as it was for my work phone.Overall, they're solid headphones, but wait to catch them at the right price.","Reviewed in the United States August 4, 2022",AF7GBXJT26ZTDSSQHDYSLC6KFJ6Q,True,126,Color: WhiteSet: Studio3

R1UGHCCYN8419,B07R5QD598,5.0 out of 5 stars Almost perfect headphones.,RowNut405,5,"I have had my Powerbeats Pro for about a week now and after a bit of a rocky start and an adjustment period, I find them to be almost perfect headphones. When I first put them on, I was wildly disappointed. They were uncomfortable and sounded tinny with no bass at all. I genuinely believed I would be returning them and getting second gen Air Pods instead. But, given how excited I was for the Powerebeats Pro to come out and the cost, I decided to put in a little effort and give them a chance. It wasn't until about 3 or 4 days in that I decided to keep them.So, if you are like me and think your new Powerbeats Pro sound like garbage when you first put them on and you wonder if all the positive reviewers are high, experiment with all the tips before dismissing the headphones as crap. In-ear buds need a good seal to sound good. I have freakishly small ears so I always start with the smallest tip available when trying out new headphones which usually works for me. Not this time. It sounded awful and I was briefly outraged that I had paid $250 for garbage. It was counter-intuitive, but I finally tried the biggest tips instead which gave me a good seal and let me wear the headphones without having to go as deep into my ears which made them more comfortable too. Once I found the right fit with a good seal, I discovered that yes, in fact, these things do actually have some nice ear-thumping bass. I think the bass is better than original Air Pods but also not overwhelming as Beats products have a reputation for being. It's satisfyingly skull shaking without being distorted and is balanced out nicely by clear highs. I'm not an audiophile by any means, but I won't listen to any old crap either. I like a little bass and good clarity and the Powerbeats Pro deliver.My biggest issue with these is comfort. As I mentioned, I have freakishly small ears and while I have been using Air Pods for a couple years, I was doing so with discomfort. I put up with a little paind because of the convenience of function. I love the automatic connection, the ability to use one bud at a time and charging on the go in the case. So, when I first read about the Powerbeats Pro, I was expecting something that would have the convenience of Air Pods with better comfort and something that wouldn't fall out of my ears all the time. Generally, I do okay with headphones that have different sizes of silicone tips so I was expecting the Powerbeats Pro to be a comfort upgrade. Initially, they actually hurt my ears more than Air Pods, especially my right ear. I fully blame this on my freakishly small ears. I'm one of those people who often finds ""one size fits all"" to be laughably ridiculous. Again, I was determined to love these things so I tinkered a bit to find an acceptable level of discomfort. The largest tip allows me to get a good seal without having to put them in so deep, relieving some pressure and cutting down on pain. When I first tried them, I could only last about 20 minutes before the pain forced me to take them out. After adjusting to find a good angle and replacing the silicone tips with Comply Sport tips, I'm a lot more comfortable and can last 2 or 3 hours before I feel discomfort. Even then, I would call it discomfort and not outright pain. It's discomfort I can live with and not any worse than what I experience with Air Pods. Also, my discomfort is only in my right ear instead of both like I get with Air Pods. Since I go with one bud a lot of the time, I'll just use the left one. No biggie. I can't blame the manufacturer for my tiny ears which is why I'm not taking away a star.On the plus side, the fit is very secure. I have worked out in them several times and they don't budge. I never could work out in Air Pods because they fell out all the time. I can also wear these while laying down which I couldn't do in Air Pods without them falling out periodically. Also, the connection is great. Original Air Pods used to randomly lose connection or not connect when they were supposed to. The chip upgrade in the Powerbeats Pro seems to have resolved this little annoyance. They connect faster and after a week, I haven't experienced a drop or glitch once.The Powerbeats Pro do come with a tradeoff when it comes to the size of the case. If you are used to carrying around Air Pods in your pocket in their tiny case, forget about it with Powerbeats Pro. The case is significantly larger. It goes in a bag or purse without taking up a ton of room but it's too big to fit comfortably in a pocket. The extra battery life for Powerbeats is nice though. I frequently use one bud at a time and used to drain an Air Pod and have to switch ears regularly. I'm using the Powerbeats Pro the same way and haven't drained a bud yet. I'm okay with the bigger case since the better battery life makes me feel secure about leaving the case at home when I need to go bagless.So in summary, these are the best sounding buds I have used. They are super convenient, easy to connect and won't fall out of your ears. If you have normal human sized ears, they will probably be comfortable and the battery life is great. You have to deal with a bigger case but the positive improvements over Air Pods make the size trade-off worth it. If you don't hear the bass, try different tips and twist them around a bit before you give up. Hopefully you won't have to work as hard at it as I did to find your happy place with Powerbeats Pro but the effort has been worth it. These are really great headphones and worth the price.","Reviewed in the United States June 3, 2019",AEZQV6K6UB6ELDP4O35DTDLARIRQ,True,960,Color: BlackStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+
R2WMIQOXTJA88Q,B07R5QD598,5.0 out of 5 stars The best Earphones you will ever buy...,Mike,5,"These are probably the best Bluetooth earbuds I have ever bought. There is one bug, but it is very easy to fix and it rarely happens. Occasionally (I am saying like once every 3 months), the earbuds will disconnect from my device and stop playing sound. The easy fix is to turn off Bluetooth and turn it back on. I have read reviews of similar occurrences and people are thinking it is Bluetooth interference. I do not think that is what it is. Just happens randomly. I use them every day and sometimes I lose connection with no other Bluetooth devices around. But other than one small bug, these earbuds rock! I will use one earbud at a time and rotate them when one earbud is low. Each earbud lasts about 9 hours and the base charges an additional 24 hours, which means I make my earbuds last about 42 hours. Bluetooth range is excellent. Sound quality is excellent. Does get loud but it does not completely cancel out sound (like a vacuum running). Earbuds are very relaxing on the ears and I wear them all day. Works with my 2 computers, Windows and Chromebook. Works with my Samsung S8 and my Samsung tablet. I do have an old iPod touch (gen 2) and it did not support it. But these are made for apple so you will get the most of it using an iPhone. Did some research and with the iPhone, you can use Siri by holding down the button on the earbud and you can get a battery status of the powerbeats on the phone. Android, Windows, and Chromebook do not support these features. Unless there was an update recently and they fixed it. I tested all of this out months ago when I first got my powerbeats. What I love the most about these powerbeats is the security of the earbuds. To sync to new devices, the user must hold down the sync button, then connect. Once connected, the user can connect to the earbuds when they are not connected to another device. Let me give you an example. I have these connected to my laptop, phone, tablet, etc. I can take one earbud with me and put in my pocket. The charging base is at home and I am out doing errands. I can turn on my Bluetooth on my phone, find the powerbeats under Paired Devices, and it connects. I then can disconnect from my phone and connect to my tablet. Once they are connected, they remain connected. It will never switch devices. The earbuds are never in discoverable mode unless you sync them. So, someone else that has Bluetooth on and is searching for a device will not even see it, even though it is not connected to anything. With most Bluetooth devices, if it is on and disconnected, people can see the device. The last thing I will talk about is the sensor in the earbud. So far it works with all my devices. If I take out my earbud, the music or movie that is playing will stop and once I put the earbud back on, it resumes on its own. I guess one thing I do not like is that there is no battery indicator on the charging base. I will use them every day and forget to check the battery life on the charging base. Usually every 2 or 3 days I will charge the base to make sure it is always charged. Whenever the Powerbeats Pro 2 come out, hopefully they add this feature. Like 4 lights on the bottom, indicating 25, 50, 75, and 100%. The 25 should blink when almost dead. But other than that, I love my powerbeats pro!","Reviewed in the United States November 12, 2020",AFCOUVNYR4HCD3YRXCTDVFA6JI3A,True,37,Color: BlackStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+
R7FPOTZIXQMHE,B07R5QD598,5.0 out of 5 stars Exceptional Performance,Fadi Shamaan,5,"I recently purchased the Beats Powerbeats Pro Wireless Earbuds and I am extremely impressed with their performance. These earbuds are truly exceptional in every way and I would give them a 5 out of 5 star rating.Firstly, the sound quality of these earbuds is outstanding. The bass is deep and the highs are crisp, providing an overall clear and balanced sound. Additionally, the volume can be turned up quite loud without any distortion, which is perfect for those who like to listen to their music at high volumes. The earbuds also provide excellent noise isolation, allowing you to fully immerse yourself in your music.One of the most impressive features of these earbuds is their battery life. With up to 9 hours of listening time, these earbuds can easily last an entire day without needing to be charged. This is especially impressive considering the compact size of the earbuds. The charging case also provides an additional 24 hours of battery life, meaning you can go days without needing to charge the earbuds.The Beats Powerbeats Pro also feature the Apple H1 headphone chip, which provides a seamless connection to your Apple devices. The earbuds connect instantly and stay connected without any issues. The Class 1 Bluetooth technology also provides an excellent range, allowing you to move freely without any loss of connection.These earbuds are also sweat and water-resistant, making them perfect for workouts or outdoor activities. The earbuds have been designed to stay securely in your ears, even during the most intense workouts.Finally, the built-in microphone on these earbuds is excellent. The microphone provides clear audio and cancels out any background noise, ensuring that your voice is heard loud and clear on phone calls.Overall, I highly recommend the Beats Powerbeats Pro Wireless Earbuds. They are an exceptional product that provides outstanding sound quality, long battery life, seamless connectivity, and are sweat and water-resistant. These earbuds are perfect for anyone looking for high-quality wireless earbuds that can keep up with their active lifestyle.Here's a comparison between the Beats Powerbeats Pro Wireless Earbuds and the Bose SoundSport Free Wireless EarbudsBeats Powerbeats Pro:• Price: $249.95• Connectivity: Class 1 Bluetooth• Battery Life: 9 hours (24 hours with case)• Charging Time: 5 minutes for 1.5 hours• Water Resistance: Sweat and water resistant (IPX4)• Microphone: Yes• Noise Cancellation: No• Audio Quality: Good• Design: Ear hooks for secure fit• Compatibility: Works with iOS and AndroidBose SoundSport Free:• Price: $199.00• Connectivity: Bluetooth 5.0• Battery Life: 5 hours (10 hours with case)• Charging Time: 2 hours• Water Resistance: Sweat and water resistant (IPX4)• Microphone: Yes• Noise Cancellation: No• Audio Quality: Very good• Design: Ear hooks for secure fit• Compatibility: Works with iOS and AndroidBoth the Beats Powerbeats Pro and the Bose SoundSport Free are great wireless earbuds with some similar features such as sweat and water resistance, ear hooks for secure fit, and microphone. However, there are some differences in terms of connectivity, battery life, and price.The Beats Powerbeats Pro has Class 1 Bluetooth which provides a longer range and stronger connectivity compared to the Bose SoundSport Free's Bluetooth 5.0. The Powerbeats Pro also has a longer battery life with 9 hours of listening time and 24 hours with the charging case compared to the Bose SoundSport Free's 5 hours of listening time and 10 hours with the charging case. However, the Powerbeats Pro is more expensive than the Bose SoundSport Free.In terms of audio quality, both earbuds have good sound quality, but the Bose SoundSport Free is considered to have a slightly better audio quality than the Powerbeats Pro. Additionally, neither earbud has noise cancellation.Overall, both earbuds are great options depending on your needs and budget. If you want longer battery life and stronger connectivity, the Beats Powerbeats Pro may be the better choice, but if you're looking for better value for your money and slightly better audio quality, the Bose SoundSport Free could be a good option.Here's a comparison between the Beats Powerbeats Pro Wireless Earbuds and the Sony WF-1000XM4 Wireless Earbuds in a points form:Beats Powerbeats Pro Wireless Earbuds:• Price: $249.95 USD• Battery Life: Up to 9 hours• Charging Case Battery Life: Up to 24 hours• Water Resistance: Sweat and water resistant• Bluetooth Version: Class 1 Bluetooth 5.0• Noise Cancellation: No• Transparency Mode: Yes• Voice Assistant: Siri (iOS) / Google Assistant (Android)• Driver Size: 9mm• Weight: 20.3gSony WF-1000XM4 Wireless Earbuds:• Price: $279.99 USD• Battery Life: Up to 8 hours (with ANC on)• Charging Case Battery Life: Up to 24 hours• Water Resistance: IPX4 water resistance• Bluetooth Version: Bluetooth 5.2• Noise Cancellation: Yes, with advanced ANC technology• Transparency Mode: Yes• Voice Assistant: Google Assistant / Alexa• Driver Size: 6mm• Weight: 7.3gAs you can see, the Beats Powerbeats Pro have a longer battery life and are sweat and water-resistant, making them ideal for workouts and outdoor activities. However, the Sony WF-1000XM4 offer advanced noise cancellation technology and are lighter in weight.The price difference is also worth noting, with the Sony WF-1000XM4 being more expensive than the Beats Powerbeats Pro. Ultimately, the choice between the two will depend on your personal preferences and needs.","Reviewed in the United States April 6, 2023",AH2UZ52SQ4HSIYYUEBYBY6R76JEA,True,126,Color: BlackStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+
RYGNKCJF3Q2P3,B07R5QD598,5.0 out of 5 stars Glad I waited for the Powerbeats Pro!,Patrick,5,"I want to preface this before I say anything about these headphones: I primarily use headphones for music and podcasts while I am cycling, running, or sitting at my desk at work. I use Spotify for music, and I am not an audiophile. I am not comparing these to a pair of Sennheisers with a lossless audio format as my source. I also am using an iPhone 7+ and iPad Air 2 for my devices in this review.I have been waiting on a getting a pair of truly wireless headphones because none seemed to be worth it to me. The battery life is usually dismal for obvious reasons, and most had complaints of cutouts between the earbuds. Some friends of mine have Air Pods and they all said they didn’t have cutout issues and battery life was pretty good. But, I just didn’t like the design of the Air Pods and they sounded “hollow” to me. But I get their appeal.I am so glad I waited for the Powerbeats Pro (PBP)! I was using the Jaybird X3 before I got these, and I think the sound is on par with them. One of my main annoyances with the X3’s was that the cord would tug once sweat built up on my neck while exercising, and I couldn’t use the cable shortener they provide because of the way my helmet is. I went for a bike ride yesterday with the PBP’s, and they were fantastic! It was a little windy, so I did get a little wind noise. I am hoping Comply makes some tips for these because I think that would make the noise isolation much better. My ride was around 2 hours and I still had 80% left on the PBP battery.Cons:1. The case: it’s actually smaller than I thought, but would still be uncomfortable in a pocket. I think the 9 hour battery life on the actual headphones make this acceptable, but this may be deal breaker for some.2. Ear fatigue: I didn’t have any fatigue during my ride, but my ears were definitely a little sensitive where the hook was resting after I took the headphones off. I’m hoping this gets better as I wear them.3. Like the Air Pods, the PBP’s can only be connected to one device at a time. They will pair to all Apple devices on your iCloud account, but if you want to switch between devices, you have to go into your Bluetooth settings and select them. On Android you will need to pair each device separately.4. I usually listen to a podcast when I go to sleep. These are not comfortable to lay on if you are side sleeper like I am. Also, the button the headphones will get pushed by the pillow. The button doesn’t require much force, which is great because your not shoving the headphones into your ear. Not a huge deal, but just thought I would mention it.Pros:1. Great sound for Truly wireless, I think.2. Great fit for exercise.3. Pretty good sound isolation, but like I said, I am hoping Comply makes some tips for these.4. Actual headphones are smaller than I thought they would be, and they don’t look weird on you when you are just walking down the street.Bottom line, if you use an iOS device and use headphones while exercising, I can’t recommend these enough! In my opinion, the $250 price tag is worth it given where other truly wireless headphones are priced.","Reviewed in the United States May 20, 2019",AFC6P5DEIQ7DYDV66DZV6TBFB3IA,True,1290,Color: BlackStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+
RT337LQW55P9W,B07R5QD598,4.0 out of 5 stars Running Earphone Showdown - These were my winner,Joe,4,"EDIT: 4 months inThe sound quality of these headphones are still great and I'm still really pleased with these being my final choice. That being said, I'm dropping it from 5 stars to 4 because the connectivity issues and power issues are driving me insane. And the fact that these are premium earbuds while still having these issues is just inane. Also, I have an android, so I'm not sure if these issues exist with Apple users or not (I'm guessing at least the second issue does, if not both).First: when you put the earbuds back in the case, you have to really work at finangling them inside the case to make sure they actually register as being put away and auto disconnect from the phone. This isn't the biggest issue, it's just maybe a 30 second annoyance. But 30 second annoyance every single time you put them away gets to be more and more annoying.Second: The earbuds have been losing charge inside the case. This didn't ever happen before until I recently went on a trip and flew somewhere. The earbuds were fully charged before takeoff, and completely dead at landing. I have no idea why this happened, but I assumed it was a fluke. It happened again on the way back. Since then, the earbuds have been draining to 0% in the case without me using them. I'm not sure if this is causation or even correlation, or just pure terrible coincidence. But it is infuriating. I'm showing up to workouts and can't use them because they're dead. It's also worth noting that I did the software update around the same time as the travel, so it could be because of that software update rather than something weird about flying (which probably makes more sense).Either way, it's absolutely infuriating.Again, sound quality is still there, but the stars will continue to drop if I can't get a fix at least for this second issue.Original Review:I was looking for new earphones specifically for fitness with the main usage test being running. I wanted to test across several price points to see which would be most worth the money. I've only had cheap running earphones before (though I have nicer cans that I use to listen with in other scenarios and some nice wired in ears for when I perform live). I don't really care about noise cancelling. My primary criteria were about comfort (and if it can stay in my ear while running), and the sound quality vs price (how much marginal return do I get per dollar). I ended up picking a premium pair because you can really notice how much more digital/fake the audio sounds when testing side by side, the lower down in price you go.(note: a lot of what I put were just notes I was jotting down while testing them. I try to do a more succinct summary in the first line of each option, and then it gets more rambly/random after that)In the running:Sony WF-1000XM4 $189.00 | Beats Fit Pro - $179 | Power Beats Pro - $179 | Jabra Elite 4 Active - $89 | JBL Endurance Peak 3 - $89.95 | Soundcore Sport X10 - $69.99 | JLab JBuds Air Sport - $69.88 | Golrex $29.99 | BMani T16 $39.99Here are my thoughts:Power Beats Pro - $179 (149) - My winner overallSounds great. It is not the best sound I've heard in earphones, but doesn't seem to lack anything. Has good thumpy bass, presence in the mids, and good clarity up high. Nothing to complain about the sound.Big/heavy case (doesn't matter that much, but I do take these on big hikes so smaller case would have been nicer)I think ultimately will be more comfortable for long use than the Fit pro. The stock medium tips fit fine, unlike the fit pro for some reason.Sounds essentially the exact same as the fit pro which makes senseBeats Fit Pro - $179I wanted this to be my favorite. It's light, small, has fun color options, and sounds great. But it ultimately was just not comfortable enough to leave in my ears for longer than 45 minutes. This would vary from person to person obviously.Pretty comfortable, but had to switch to the small eartips (only earbuds I had to switch from the medium/stock tips). Stays in the ears well, but I think that the whole thing being in there will get uncomfortable pushing my ears after a while. Really little case which is nice.Really great clarity, feels perfectCan't find any eq in the app, but I didn't feel the need to adjust any eq settings either, every band/frequency was very satisfying, so that's kind of nice not having to set it myselfSony WF-1000XM4 $189.00I believe this has a slightly fuller sound quality to it. Can't really pinpoint how or why, but seems to be the most superior sound quality of all of them. I thought it might be better bass but that's not it. I can't pick a part any individual component that seem superior, it just has an overall fuller soundThere just doesn't seem to be any way that these are going to stay in during a run. Would be great for any non-exercise application, but just wasn't what I was looking for. I would choose these if I were looking for just walk around town kind of earbuds.Jabra Elite 4 Active - $89Great clarity and bass out of the box. I am the kind of guy who can only really tell sound differences when a/b testing it. If I only listened to these earbuds, I would have been fully satisfied with the sound quality, the comfort, and the security. It's only because I tested it next to the premium models above that I decided not to go with this. But if this is your budget range, these are definitely the winners.Excessively comfortable, like the most comfortable of any of the earbuds (premiums included), and feel like they will stay in on a run even though they don't have any sort of little hook like the soundcore or powerbeats, or over ear hook like the others. Definitely the best ergonomics. Would take this over the JBL endurance or any other in the sub $150 price range.Soundcore Sport X10 - $69.99more satisfying for non edm music than the other options down below. Better separation for instruments and vocals.Compared against JLabs with blue tips in, the bass is more comparable. Soundcore keeps more clarity than on higher end (albeit a little tinny sounding), than JLabsBass is definitely much better than JLabs. It does feel a bit more muddy because of the heavier bass, there may have been better vocal clarity with JLabsEverything else seems fineANC is decentsmall profile is light, really comfortable and stays in the earsJLab JBuds Air Sport - $69.88bigger profile, slightly less comfortable than the Soundcore. Bass is lacking out of the box. There's better mid and high clarity on these than the soundcore.Bass improves a noticeable amount by switching to blue tips, but you lose some clarity higher upbass feels punchier in edm in these than x10These are definitely more satisfying for thumpy edm music than the x10The sound quality just feels lacking in depth, no matter which eq setting you choose.Has a connected usb charger on the case as a charger (rather than a separate chord to plug into both charger and power), which I don't think I likeJBL Endurance Peak 3 - $89.95Clear vocals and instruments in mids and highs. Slightly more clear and crisp than the soundcoreNice bass as well, (slightly worse bass than soundcore), less satisfying than the sound core on lyrical song but actually has punchier bass on edmPlenty loud (other reviews saying they don't get loud)The equalizer app gives lots of controlThis bass is also superior once equalized. So both bass and instrumental/vocals have more clarity. After messing with eq, is better than soundcore.This sounded perfectly fine until compared with higher tier, then when a/b compared it sounded a bit more fake, a bit more digital, definitely enough to notice a differenceGolrex $29.99It is okay sound, probably the best in this price range. If you just want something cheap that will give you sound, these are fine. If you care about sound quality even a little bit, it's worth it to get a better headset.There is no clarity at any frequency, just a decent amount of noise.Has an attempted cheap premium look with led interfaces.BMani T16 $39.99Sounds way below average, worse than the golrex.Really similar packaging and look to the golrex, so they're either just copying each other or made by the same people","Reviewed in the United States August 14, 2023",AFSRAJU6KF7ZSMZHCEC3IM34FTLA,True,191,Color: NavyStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+

R18ML2DXNSHGXX,B07R5QD598,1.0 out of 5 stars I didn't know a product could be so poorly designed.,RIR,1,"This is a review for use with android and macbook proTLDR most glitchy product i've ever had in my life. Updates are few and far between and bring new glitches. Most common glitch is sound going out of sync between left and right resulting in delay, and feeling of echo in the audio: it's infuriating and requires disconnect and reconnect: sometimes with waiting in between or having to repair from box which makes the big bulky charge box a must carry everywhere: can't exactly go ona run with that thing.Imagine having to interrupt your sports routine 2-4 times to get these things working, does that make you want to work out more or less?Since i first bought them, they have been nothing but glitchy, and it took two months to have them replaced on apple care (because apple after sale service is a joke) so i made a glitch diary over the past few weeks to write this review.Android: many of these glitches are not android dependent but rather location/movement dependent, or where you put your phone dependent, or what your phone is touching dependent or next to what appliance you're standing dependent and sometimes audio app dependent (switching apps resolves the glitch).Glitches are ""seasonal"" they come and go, though some are constant. But there's always something new.-Worst and by most common glitch: the earbuds often go out of sync resulting in an echo (bc of the delay btw one ear and the other). This one is infuriating/maddening: happens everyday many times. Sometimes i just live with it because i don't want to go through the motions of disconnecting/wait/reconnect but the sync keeps drifting and it gets jarring/disorienting after a while: like chinese drip torture.- powerbeats connect, sound still comes from phone speakers-“skipping sound effect” from the connection faltering-sometimes nonstop struggle to stay in sync, stay connected-Sounds cuts in and out repeatedly with random intervals (on... off........ on.... off... on........ off...)-put them in a box and close it only to realize they’re still connected and the sound is coming out of the box still, but sometimes the opposite problem occurs: i'd be listening from macbook speakers and they. randomly connect to the laptop and start playing from within the box, and pause playback. Must turn off bluetooth on device to recover sound from speakers.-sometimes resumes all audio app after you pause and play (eg pause podcast, hit play, youtube, podcasts, audible all start playing together at the same time)- Different buttons/functions cease to work, sometimes all buttons won’t respond (sound plays buttons unresponsive), sometimes just some buttons, just volume or play, or just one earbud.-Sometimes buttons work but no sound (can see the app play/pause on the screen)-Sometimes connects (as confirmed by connection sound and bluetooth menu on phone) but no sound and buttons unresponsive. Sometimes no sound though buttons can play/pause-lag between commands and response (btw hitting play and music playing, pause and music pausing)- often disconnects from phone after a call: when you hang up sound resumes from phone speakers-sometimes disconnects during call making me run back to phone to continue call on phone- sometimes one of the earbuds ""forgets"" its charged straight out of the box, putting it back in the charge box ""reminds"" it it's actually full (goes from 0% to 100% immediately): imagine you put them on step out of the. house and realize one of the earbuds is acting dead, now you have to go back home, stick it in the huge box you don't want to carry around and. then g et back to your run/bike/routine-rarely, one earbud ""dies"" and needs to be placed in charging box for a long while before it comes back to ""life""-updates few and far between and bring new glitches- EVERYTIME I ride (bike) through specific intersections it ""slices"" the connection: audio goes out though the app continues to play and the connection is still established in the bluetooth menu.Recently (new ""seasonal"" glitches since last update ):-just doesn't automatically connect when i open box and put them on, I have to manually connect them from the bluetooth menu, sometimes i have to repair them from the box.- one ear starts playing immediately, other earbud takes 6-9 seconds to connect, during which you're standing there. waiting to see if it's this glitch or the one where one of the earbuds thinks it's empty and needs to be put back in the box to remember it's full.-earbuds connect but they don't make the connection sound so you don't know if they've connected or not without playing something- entire volume range is on the bottom three increments of the volume bar, goes from no sound (one volume click up) 50% volume (one volume click up) 100% volume and all the rest of the range no matter how much you volume up/down, remains at 100% volume.Macbook pro-refuses to connect/reconnect to macbook pro, no idea why, requires a factory reset and re pairing-randomly switches to another device mid use (from phone to macbook pro or vice versa)Sound Quality: bass ok, HIGH TREBLE many podcasts sound like there's a hissing in your ear when they pronounce the letter S. Overall sound is good but the hissing from the high trebble is annoying: one solution to this i found was to use biggest size rubber buds and shove them well into your ear: enhances bass and mitigates treble.Customer service: took nine days to ship them back to some facility to have them ""looked at"" decided they were fine within twenty minutes (i know this because they have a link to a tracker) and returned them to me (they had to overnight ship them when I blew a gasket at the store when i realized the confirmation email after nine days was just for their receipt of the product at the repair facility and not that they were done and ready for pickup: nine days, just to get from the store to the ""repair"" facility).Had to return twice more and both times same thing: they receive them, immediately decide nothing wrong with them, return them: spent the whole summer without the product i had bought SPECIFICALLY for that summer. In the end some ""genius"" i paris told me it was because they were labeling the problem as ""permanent"" as opposed to ""intermittent"" (permanent means it's always there and so it should show right out of the box)Please comment if you've been having any of these problems.thanks100% would not recommend","Reviewed in the United States October 14, 2020",AHODWZEEKYACPAUAQYJHC5MGJDQA,True,166,Color: BlackStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+
R1OI66NEAOV8TP,B07R5QD598,"5.0 out of 5 stars Well done, Beats! I would buy again... and again... and again!!!",Dillon & Cassandra,5,"I have had these for one day now and so far I love them. They are my first Beats and they have lived up to the name. They fit very snugly but also comfortably which has been hard to find. Sound quality is fantastic. I’m not an expert on sound by any means but I am very pleased with the sound from my music, podcasts and even phone calls.I have an iPhone and pairing was almost too easy to the point that I wasn’t sure if they were really paired until I started listening. It also has a nice little display when you open the case near your phone that shows battery level of the earphones as well as the case. (The case charges the earphones when they are in place).They feel very well made which was to be expected as they are Beats (Apple) after all. The case is also very nice. It’s slightly larger than expected but it could easily fit in my jacket pocket so I’m not complaining. The case has a high quality feel to it with one exception: when fully opened, the lid seems to wiggle as if it were a little loose. This was definitely not a deal breaker for me considering I didn’t buy it for the case, but rather the headphones. Just something to be aware of. When you close the case, it resumes the nice feel with a sort of snap that I’m guessing is from a magnet.As I said before, the earphones are very comfortable. I could wear them for hours and not get sore ears. I am not an athlete but I am constantly moving around the house and leaning over etc. and they will stay in until you take them out. Another benefit is that if you slightly twist them forward on your ears, it breaks the seal so that you can hear what’s going on around you, but you can still hear your music etc. it would have been nice if they had integrated the transparency technology that uses the microphones for you to hear through the actually earphones what’s going on around you but this feature works just as well. In the booklet, it mentions adjusting the “around-the-ear” hook but it seems like it just bends to different angles. My only complaint about this product which isn’t really by fault of the beats is that the hooks rub against my glasses a little. It’s not enough to make me return them and I only notice it sometimes. It’s really just a minor nuisance, but if you’re the kind of person that would be bothered by that, don’t get ones with ear hooks. It comes with 4 sets of in-ear rubber pieces. One of them on the earbuds and the other four in the packaging. So far I haven’t switched them out because they felt just fine with the ones that were already on.This brings me to packaging. I thought the packaging was excellent. Again, I expect this from a product made by Apple and I was not at all disappointed. It felt like opening a very intricate gift.Overall, I LOVE this product. I was hesitant about the price to begin with but after having them, I realize it was well worth the sale price of $170. I would even pay the previous price of $200 for them. I would absolutely recommend these! Especially if you have an iPhone (for simplified pairing and connectivity) and if you want something that stays in but doesn’t hurt (who wouldn’t want that??)!","Reviewed in the United States December 6, 2020",AE6VVWAS3GJMQ7KNIXVV7UE37TXA,True,2,Color: BlackStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+
R2SSCQ784MXTDM,B07R5QD598,5.0 out of 5 stars AMAZING sound quality and you can work out hard without them budging,Andrea,5,LOVE these. Technically they don't have a noise cancellation setting that you can turn on and off but the volume button kind of activates the noise cancellation feature. I love taking phone calls with these because they never fall out of my head and I can have as sassy of a conversation as I want without flinging a bud halfway across the room . If you work out with alot of movement and really slip in to beast mode these will be perfect for you because they don't budge at all and it really allows you to get in the zone without having to re-adjust the bud in fear of losing one .,"Reviewed in the United States July 3, 2024",AGTZDYPWYBT7436UKAV5J5WDY2JQ,True,0,Color: IvoryStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+

They have great sound, and they stay put in my ear through all movement and sweat. I thought these were the best exercise earbuds I had ever had, but of course right at the one year mark the left one stopped working. The left ear bud won't charge in the case no matter how much I fiddle with it.

R1MY99OSW5FWG7,B07R5QD598,4.0 out of 5 stars Amazing Wireless Earbuds,Garrett,4,"These are really amazing wireless earbuds. I'm gonna do pros and cons along with some other thoughts about this product. This review is written 4 months after using this product.Pros:1. Battery life. The battery life is amazing. I never had these die on me except when I play video games all night. They also have fast charging which is very useful if you need to charge them real quick.2. Fit. The fit is really perfect. They feel comfortable and they stay in my ears perfectly. I exercise a lot and these earbuds always stay in my ears when I'm at the gym and when I'm running. If you are looking for some workout earbuds, then these will give you reliable and beautiful performance.3. Sound quality. The sound quality is amazing. Nice, clear and crisp.4. The Apple features. The extra features that the Powerbeats have when using with apple devices are nice but don't let those features discourage you android users from buying the Powerbeats. The features aren't important enough for you to decide not to buy them (Not gonna list out the features in order to make this review shorter)5. Range. The range is amazing. I can be listening to music on my phone and leave my phone in my room and walk anywhere in the house and still be able to listen to the music. The music starts cutting out depending on the amount of objects blocking the signal.6. Ability to wear with glasses. I can wear these with my glasses with no problem at all. I can take my glasses on and off and have no trouble.7. Good microphone. I use these earbuds for phone calls and video calls and the person can hear me pretty good. I can hear them perfectly fine. My brother tells me that I sound muffled but he can still hear me good.Cons:1. Pain. After wearing them for a couple of hours, I start to feel slight discomfort. This only happens after many hours so it isn't something i'm complaining about. Just felt like I should mention it so everyone is aware. The pain that is the problem is the major pain that comes after weeks of regular use. I'm not sure what is happening but it's like the Powerbeats is making the skin inside my ear peel off. I think this is happening because they are too tight in my ears. This has happened I believe 3 times and the goes away after I left my ears heal. As i'm writing this review, I am experiencing the major pain and I adjusted the left earhook so it's not as tight in my ear as before (Problem is currently only in my left ear). I'm not sure if I'm the only one who experiences this but if you can deal with this then don't let that discourage you from buying the Powerbeats (It isn't that big of a problem for me).2. Bluetooth connection on Windows 10 computers. I'm not sure if this also happens on other versions of Windows and android devices but sometimes there would randomly be a 1-2 second cut in the sound about every two minutes. This doesn't happen at all on my iPhone. I would also experience random disconnections on my laptop. Another thing about the connection is that it is weaker on my laptop than on my phone. Not sure why.3. Bulky case. This doesn't matter to me at all because I usually have a bag that I carry with me when I go to places that I can slip the case into. I'm just mentioning it so people can be aware. You can put it in your pocket if you want but it will look weird because there will be a giant bulge in your pants.That's it about the pros and cons. Now it's time to talk about the problems I had with the Powerbeats. I'm having flashbacks of the problems I encountered while typing this part of the review. Problem 1. This only happened once but I will still talk about it. I was connecting the Powerbeats to my iPhone and forgetting them in the bluetooth settings because I was enjoying the animation that pops up when you pair them with your iPhone. Then all of a sudden they would not pair again. Man I thought they were already broken and it was the day I got them. I thought my $200 dollars went down the drain. But luckily I managed to get them to pair again after a long time of research and trying different things. What fixed the problem was charging the case because apparently since it was at I believe 30 something percent, it couldn't pair. Problem 2. This was the worst problem. I've had this problem happen twice in the last month and a half. One of the earbuds would not pair and sound would only come out of the earbud that was paired. I had to switch back to my other pair of wireless earbuds that I previously had until I figured out how to solve this problem. It took days of extensive research and multiple solution attempts before I finally managed to fix the problem. I was about to return them but luckily I solved the problem before I did.Final thoughts: Despite the cons and problems I encountered, I would still recommend these earbuds to anyone. If you encounter any of the problems I did, I hope you can easily solve them and if you don't, you can reply to my comment and ask me for my solution. Hopefully Amazon has a feature where you get notifications when someone replies to your review. If you read this whole thing, thank you and I appreciate it. If you didn't then thanks for taking a look at it.Update: I no longer experience the major pain in my ears and the skin peeling off after I adjusted the earhooks to get the right fit (Update written on 8/18/21).","Reviewed in the United States May 30, 2020",AGQAVC4ATJJ2TILHRYBPZTPL6CRA,True,355,Color: BlackStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+
R1LZX7TTL4A64Z,B07R5QD598,4.0 out of 5 stars Finally Something That Fits My Ears,Jacquelyn,4,These fit hard to fit ears. I have several ear buds by Apple but have always had problems with them falling out of my ears when I talk or move or even yawn. My ear canals must be a strange shape because nothing has worked over the years. It just occurred to me that I need something that hooks onto my ears to secure them in place and they need to be comfortable too. I have finally found a pair of earbuds that actually stay in place and have a decent sound. The buttons are easy to push. They get the job done while I am exercising.

R3705JNBSYTV9D,B07R5QD598,3.0 out of 5 stars Don't buy these if you want low maintenance earbuds.,Amazon Customer,3,"I was looking for a replacement for my Plantronics earbuds which loop around the ear so they don't fall off when I run etc. I really liked the Plantronics pair, but they were getting old and starting to have shorter usage time after each recharge. Unfortunately, Plantronics also seems to have stopped making them or bringing out new models since being acquired by Poly. I read some good reviews on Powerbeats Pro and it seemed like it would be a good replacement. I have had these for about 6 months now and here are my observations.Pros:1. Great sound - this gives you great overall sound. My previous earbuds were intentionally created to let outside noise in (for outside runners), so the quality of sound was never that great. With this, I do get great sound and depending on how snug you have them in your ears, they also block out some of the outside noises (but no true noise cancellation).2. Stays in place during the workout - This was a requirement for me and it works well.3. Connectivity with Apple devices - This was created as an Apple specific earbud. So it connects well with Apple devices and provides a lot of native functionality out of the box (just like AirPods) that you don't get with third party earbuds.4. Quick charging - You can get enough charge in 10-15 minutes to work out for a good 2 hours.Cons:1. No on/off button - There is no way to turn the earbuds on or off. They turn as soon as you take them out of the charging case (more on this later) and turn off when you put them back. So you have to carry the charging case with you if you want to have them with you for a longer period and do not want them fully discharged between use.2. Doesn't always turn on - I have had the issue when it doesn't turn on automatically when I take them out of the charging pod. So I will have to put them back in and out again AND double check they are turned on when I take them out again. Also, you have to make sure they are on in case you are leaving the house and not planning to take the charging case with you because that is the only way to turn them on.3. Bulky charging case- These aren't small (like AirPods or the Pixel ones) and not convenient to carry around when you are going out to work out.4. The right earbud seems to randomly turn on overnight and keeps discharging in the case - I researched this issue online and it seems to be a common problem for others who own them. Basically, you would leave them in the case to charge overnight (so they also turn off and disconnect from your phone). But if you check later, you might find that the right earbud is turned on and connected to your phone. Or most times, you take them out to go work out only to find that the right bud is at 10% or dying while the left earbud is at a 100%. So you are now stuck at home waiting for it to charge enough before you can leave.5. Buzzing noise on right earbud - This seems to happen sporadically too where you only hear a buzzing noise and no music. This also seems like a common issue from my research online. Based on advice from other users and Apple, I have disconnected and reconnected the earbuds and reset the earbuds several times to fix this issue. It has fixed the issue each time, but recurs after a few weeks.6. High maintenance - I don't know about you, but I would like something that I can use when I need to and forget about other times, except to put them up for charging. With #4 and #5 above, this has become another thing I need to worry about on top of everything else. I have NEVER had to worry about this in the past!7. Support - I tried to find support for this from Amazon and they pointed me toward Apple since these are supposedly distributed and sold by them. All I wanted was a fix to the above issues OR get a replacement for my earbuds which are still under warranty. But they want me to go into an Apple authorized store OR send these in and wait for them to fix it. Seems very convenient when it is something you use every day, right?Overall, if you are ready to put up with what I mention in the cons, this is still a great pair of earbuds that give really great sound for someone who loves music.","Reviewed in the United States October 22, 2023",AGVDQ44DKPRDJQRZDUFFX2NV65DQ,True,34,Color: BlackStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+

R2TRUA64RRPG39,B07R5QD598,5.0 out of 5 stars This is probably the best you can get if you have mutant-sized ears like me,Hayden Wallsinger,5,"As a quick backstory, I have a huge head. I have never had a hat that fits nor in-ear earbuds. I had been using Skullcandy earbuds because they were small enough that I could kind of just jam them into the ear canal then push on them every few minutes to keep them in. I tried Airpods, about every skullcandy variant on the market, offbrand, and more. I am happy to say that the search is over!Everyone knows about the quality of the sound that Beats have. They are well known for it and since I used to own a pair of over-ear headphones by Beats I can comfortably say the sound hasn't really changed. The build quality is impressive and no material in the box feels tacky or cheap. Although the new iPhones are using USB-C for their cable which will make this obsolete for new phones, I do appreciate that I can use the same lightning cable for my iPhone 13 that I use to charge the docking holder thingy. One less cable I need to carry around.The fit is really good. Astoundingly good. I have always preferred over-ear loops to hold buds in because I can feel a bit more secure in wearing them and it helps to keep the buds centered. In addition to having large ears and a large head, I was also given large ear canals which constantly would spit out my previous skullcandy buds over time and make me paranoid that they were going to disappear. These still leave a bit to be desired for fit as they are just slightly too small for my ears. This all being said, I am a mutant with big ears and 99.99% of the population are going to find these fit like a glove.Finally, the smaller features of the buds really helps push them over the edge. Built-in detectors on the buds detect if you are taking them off and automatically pause the music/video you are watching. This is especially crucial for a person like me who regularly has to put them on then take them off when I get accosted by coworkers on a minute-by-minute basis. The volume controls are in a good spot and I appreciate that they are an actual button instead of some of the finicky touch controls that other companies use. Finally, I find the carrying case to be extremely bulky, but with the battery life I have experienced with these buds I am not at all going to complain about it. Manufacturer spec states 9 hours in ear with the charge in the case providing a total of 24 hours. They have to be going with the modest route! They have to be! I got 38 out of them on a work trip between Seattle and Dubai. I charged the case and the buds to the max before my flight than forgot to charge them while I was away. They died about 2 hours outside SeaTac on the return flight.Overall these are quality buds with good sound quality, great build, and a range of small stuff that eliminates the hassle normally encountered with bluetooth buds. If you get asked often, ""is your hearing good with ears the size of an elephant?"" than these buds are the one for you! If you are not shamed due to your large ears, they probably will work just as well for you too.","Reviewed in the United States October 24, 2023",AF77BBBGGM7O3YF7WVQFILDXKNPQ,True,27,Color: BlackStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+

Love the action button not being a weird touch thing that constantly messes me up when I adjust them. The ear hooks are very comfy and work well. The weight is good. The battery life is great. The Bluetooth sync is always fast and easy with an iPhone. Sound isolation is good.Yo, Timmy Apple, when we gonna get a new version with new chip and precise find my abilities. I get these are perfect as is, but the find my with precision would be nice.Btw, I had my first pair for almost 6 years. I still have one bud, which works great. I bought these on impulse because the Amazon deal yesterday was too darn good. Almost same cost as a single replacement. The charge case still works and holds a charge and so do the buds, even after 5+ years.","Reviewed in the United States May 11, 2024",AFEL3TQNG2EJAEVR32UDOT4FKI5Q,True,11,Color: BlackStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+
R2KIEGX9V68B1T,B07R5QD598,5.0 out of 5 stars Get these while you can.,Mikecash_,5,"I purchased the Beats Powerbeats Pro Wireless Earbuds November of 2022, it's July of 2023 right now and I am extremely happy with this purchase. It is rumored that there will be a new model coming out soon, which may be why the price of this model is currently on sale. I would get them at the price they are while you can!There are a few possible issues with these earbuds and if I could give them 4.5 or 4.75 I would, but the pros certainly outweigh the cons - perceived or real.Pros 1st:1. Sound quality. These are so much better than the bargain earbuds that I have always used that it's not even comparable. There is a very clear and crisp sound. On an airplane or in a crowded room, you can turn the volume up as high as you want and there's no distortion in the sound.2. Noise Cancelation. While not comparable to over the ear headphones for in-ear buds I can't imagine that you would get much better.3. Wrap Around feature. When I was deciding between the Powerbeats Pro and the Apple AirPods pro. It was the wrap around feature that was the tie-breaker. I have used these earbuds in a plane, in the gym, on a hiking trail, and various other places and I have never had them fall out of my ear - which is the point. I have helped others look for their in-ear buds on planes and in the gym and I didn't want that to be me.3. Battery life and charging time. I use these earbuds almost every single day. The battery has never been an issue. Some might consider that fact that the beats use the lighting cable instead of USB-C, but for me that has been a plus. I can charge the beats case in my truck with my iPhone charger if it ever gets to it. The old problem of the buds not sitting in the case correctly and thus burning through the charge on the case after you take off the charger has been resolved. Or at least it has never one time been a problem for me.4. Additional pros. The seamless connection to your Apple devices and the range after connection are worthy mentions. The built-in microphone provides clear audio that cancels out much of the background noise. And the sweat and water-resistant quality makes them perfect for workouts or outdoor activities.Cons:1. The ""Find My"" feature on iPhone is not very helpful for the Powerbeats. If they are paired you can find them if they are laying around the house somewhere, but I don't think it would be helpful at all if you leave them behind somewhere. And you cannot see them separately, you see both the left and right side together. This is certainly one area where AirPods would have the advantage.2. The size of the case. Compared to most earbuds this case is HUGE. Most people will not want to stick them in their pocket as you can with most others. I carry them in my backpack most of the time because of the size.3. The size of the ear tips. I have tried every set that comes with the beats and I'm down to the smallest size. They fit me perfectly but I do not have the smallest ear canals.One other thing to note: These work just fine with my glasses but the arms on my glasses are straight. If you have over the ear arms, it might be more of a problem.These earbuds are perfect for anyone looking for high-quality wireless earbuds that can keep up with their active lifestyle.","Reviewed in the United States July 13, 2023",AFSNSQNQVEZTUVNT7BE4LEKOE6VQ,True,207,Color: BlackStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+

RZKYQ47MFPJKI,B07R5QD598,4.0 out of 5 stars These Buds Don't Fall Out For No One!,Raenell,4,"I purchased these after I got Apple Airpods Pro because those fell out of my ears after I leaned over to get something that fell in my car. I was very bummed about the Airpods and tried the various ear fittings, but found that it didn't matter and bought them for running and working out at the gym. Upon ordering and receiving the Powerbeats Pro, I knew that they would be a great fit and was very impressed with the fit, the various sizes of buds (5 options) to find a great fit, and the battery life is amazing! Though they are not noise-canceling, I know that these will not fall out or off of my ears and will be great for running or jumping around at the gym. The downside to these, in my opinion, is that the level of sound has to be turned up quite high and makes me worried that I'm damaging my ears. I've checked this a few times to see if it's my phone or Spotify (iPhone 12), but it's not and I'm not sure if it's a manufacturing thing. The battery lasts a very long time and I've driven for hours talking and never have the person on the other end complain of noise like my old headphones. I love it too because when someone calls, it automatically goes to my earbuds if they are in and they connect quickly. I would recommend these because they are Bluetooth, convenient, and don't hurt to have them in. In the past, I've tried over-the-ear headphones, cordless or Bluetooth, and struggled with the fit and find that these are great. I hope this is helpful for you all!","Reviewed in the United States February 24, 2024",AEJ6XIX73VYTEML3KBKMM6ERCYKQ,True,4,Color: BlackStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+

These are easy to charge and clean. And now with my Apple devices I can find them with a push of a button.

As an avid music lover, I can confidently say that these earbuds deliver rich, immersive sound that truly enhances every beat and melody.One of the standout features of these earbuds is the Apple H1 Headphone Chip, which ensures seamless connectivity and efficient power management. The Class 1 Bluetooth technology provides reliable wireless performance, allowing me to enjoy my favorite music with minimal interruptions.Additionally, the sweat-resistant design makes these earbuds perfect for workouts and outdoor activities. Whether I'm hitting the gym or going for a run, I can count on these earbuds to stay in place and deliver uninterrupted sound quality.However, the only issue I've encountered is with the stability of the earbuds during intense movement. While they fit snugly in my ears during most activities, I've noticed that they may become slightly dislodged if I'm moving around vigorously. This is a minor inconvenience for me, but it's worth noting for those who engage in high-impact activities regularly.Overall, the Beats Powerbeats Pro Wireless Earbuds are an excellent choice for anyone seeking top-notch sound quality and wireless convenience.

RLRFWMQOWEANN,B07R5QD598,"4.0 out of 5 stars A short review, if you're trying to decide on buying this...",Kevin S. Goff,4,"I've been a music junkie for decades and have had many headphones/earbuds.I'd give these a ""4 1/2 stars out of five""On the good side:1) I use Tidal with Boom on my iPhone and I have over 200 GB of music on my phone. I had to tweak the sound settings on the Boom equalizer to get sound setting I want. Out of the box, I'd say the sound quality is good but not necessarily exceptional. But if you have an equalizer, odds are higher you'll be satisfied.2) I've found that the battery life is indeed about 9 hours and the charging time is about what they advertise.3) As for the fit: these are not going to fall out or slip (unless someone walks up to you and physically tries to pull them out). The fit is perfect. (See my notes further down for the ""comfort"")4) I've rarely had problems pairing. I've used these nearly every day for a year and a half and have rarely had pairing issues with the iPhone. I can't speak for Android, as I don't use it.OK, the ""not so good"" side:1) The charging case does not support wireless charging.2) The charging case is a tad large (in fairness, these buds are larger, hence the better battery life). You ""can"" put it in your pockets (pants) but you'll notice it.3) OK, on the comfort: the human ear isn't designed to have something stuck into it for hours at a time without feeling the pressure. Yes, there are some buds that fit in a way that you won't feel the pressure, though I have to wonder what the downside is, as far as secure fit and seal.Having said that, if I have these in my ears for more than 90 minutes, I sometimes need to take them out for a few minutes, just to let my ears ""breathe"".Overall, give this 4.5 stars out of 5. The three things I mentioned are not ""deal breakers"" for me, but they might be if you are looking for something that will feel comfortable for hours. As much as I love these (and I do love them), I do need to pull them out for a few minutes.Also, there is no ANC. Yes, there's ""noise reduction"" but not cancellation. I'm mainly in the suburbs and really don't have the need for ANC. However, it's always a personal choice, and if you spend a great deal of time in a noisy city/transportation system, you might want to look at the newest Bose.So - these are not perfect. but they are very good and I'm happy with them. I love the battery life, the secure fit, and overall sound quality (after some tweaking). I listen to tons of jazz and classical and 70's rock and am happy with these.I had a few wireless buds before these, and was always wondering if ""the grass is greener"" with another set. I have to be honest, after buying these, my interest in finding better ones down the road is much lower.Most reviews I've read are positive on this product. Yes, a few negative ones, but mostly positive. I bought these when they were a bit pricier, and even though they've dropped the price a bit, I'm not angry - I really like them a lot.","Reviewed in the United States May 15, 2022",AGPCSSLIATSAHUEUEFPDOK2WLTWQ,True,55,Color: BlackStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+

The ear hooks help keep the earbuds in and I don't have to worry about losing one earbud due to it falling out, unlike the Apple Airpods that I keep finding on the ground at work... Having purchased this product a discounted price, I am very satisfied.The only problem I have with this product is the longevity of the batteries of the earbuds and charging case as time passes. After about the 2 year mark, the earbud that is used the most will last about 1-1.5 hours listening to audio and 15 minutes while on a voice call. The lithium ion batteries degrade too rapidly for a product at this price range.Overall, this is a great product, but I wish there was an battery alternative, because even just replacing the batteries at a local electronic repair store is about the same price as brand new Powerbeats at a discount ( approx $150 total to replace the earbud batteries ).","Reviewed in the United States February 9, 2024",AEXTQVIKQK72BB6WPCVVUX73H3KQ,True,0,Color: NavyStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+

R2QLUHTUKVZ0S4,B07R5QD598,4.0 out of 5 stars After 3 years…,Digimartyr,4,"I bought these back in 2020, and have been using them ever since. It’s been about a year, but the microphone has degraded and is highly inefficient. It’s amazingly convenient that if you’re listening to music, or just have these in your ear, it’ll pause when you receive a call. You’re then able to press the button to answer. Thing is, the person I’m speaking to would say that I sound muffled and very far away. I’d say in the initial two years that I’ve had these they’ve worked flawlessly. Now I’d have to disconnect from Bluetooth and answer a call as you normally would. It’s very annoying to do when you expect that to be a function of these.Also, when charging the headphones in the case, the nodes on the headphones (or on the case) have degraded to the point where I’d have to keep them pushed down for the connection to be made. It’s a bit frustrating when I forget to do so only to find that one ear has lost power when I thought it was charging the entire time.Otherwise, because they wrap around your ear I’ve NEVER feared them falling out. It hasn’t even been close to coming out when going for a run or going to the gym. They can be cumbersome if you have long hair that covers your ears, but you’ll get use to pushing your hair back to fit them in. I’ve had long hair, and dreads, so trust that that becomes less of an issue as time goes on.Otherwise these perform quite well as headphones on the go. For the bells and whistles of noise cancellation, “aware mode” (being able to hear what’s around you), and top notch sound quality, I leave that to around the ear headphones. It’s of little significance to me with these little things.**EDIT**So, while both headphones are in, the left ears power gets depleted much faster than the left. When checking the power it still reads at least 50%, the right ear being 80%. It’ll then require another charge before working again. So……there’s that too…","Reviewed in the United States November 14, 2023",AF4TDDEJFZEQ4TPUNVXBQRRLKM3Q,True,4,Color: BlackStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+

R3HL180XQU0CCI,B07R5QD598,3.0 out of 5 stars Powerbeats Pro have a tinny sound and hurt my ears,MikeW,3,"For the price I paid I expected superior sound but the Powerbeats Pro sound tinny with no Bass. After wearing them to the gym for a couple of hours my ears were sore. Sound was superior and fit more comfortable with my old and less expensive Plantronics earbuds which, unfortunately, are no longer made. They did connect and set up on my iPhone very easily but for the price I expected more. I have debated sending them back but I bought the Apple Care with them and don’t want the hassle involved in returning them. I only wear them cycling, running and at the gym so I will probably just live with them. Tried changing the ear tips but it didn’t help with the Bass or comfort. I wouldn’t recommend these.Update to my review of Feb 1, 2023. The left ear bud frequently failed to charge and both earbuds had problems connecting forcing me to go to settings Bluetooth and forget the device and reinstall. Now the earbuds in the case will not connect to my iPhone. I did get AppleCare+ with the earbuds and called tech support but nothing we did would get the earbuds to connect. They are sending a replacement and hopefully it will perform better than the original earbuds. I would not consider purchasing these without the AppleCare extended warranty.Next update: Received my new Powerbeats earbuds and case. At first they charged great, no problem. Now after a month one of earbuds will fail to charge. I have to repeatedly check them to make sure both earbuds are charging. They use magnets to pull the earbuds into place but you still need to push them down to insure the buds are connecting properly to charge. When you close the case often one of the earbuds will lose connection and not charge but will in fact discharge. I constantly get ready to go for a run or to the gym and discover that one esrbud is 100% charged and the other one has no charge or is at 2% or so and will not operate. I then have to try and readjust the discharged earbud in the case and wait for it to charge before going. Annoying to say the least. Also if you sweat while working out, running, etc the contacts will quickly corrode and you have to clean them regularly for them to recharge. Definitely wish I had not purchased these but for the price I paid I can’t afford to just throw them away and buy a different brand. For the next 2 years I guess I will just keep using my AppleCare to return them when they stop working properly.UPDATE: May 15, 2023. Well the left earbud started failing to charge. Cleaned contacts with alcohol using a cotton Q-Tip. Didn’t help. Finally manually reset the charging case and the left earbud started charging though it stalled several times at 50% charged. Finally got the left earbud to charge but have the feeling that these will soon be going back to AppleCare for replacement.UPDATE: July 4, 2023. Left earbud still failing to charge unless I play with it in the case until the red charging light comes on. Then for seemingly no reason it will stop charging and start discharging so that when I go to bed it is charged at 90% but when I get up in the morning to go for my run the right earbud is still fully charged but the left one is now down to 10%. Found out that there is a class action suit being prepared against the Beats Powerbeats pro in several states because of these charging issues Unfortunately Florida is not one of the states in the lawsuit. DO NOT PURCHASE THESE EARBUDS. In the end you will be unhappy if you do.","Reviewed in the United States February 1, 2023",AE57GQUQQAOW6EK6JFTU6UCBW2HA,True,13,Color: NavyStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+

R1XRA40FXWHENG,B07R5QD598,4.0 out of 5 stars good but lots of cons,sayock,4,"These are the best earphones I’ve ever tried, including more expensive Bose earphones. But there are definitely many cons.-I agree with those who say the midrange is lacking in quality.-As with most earphones, the sound quality decreases dramatically depending on what size ear cups you use on the earphones. The powerbeats pro totally wireless come with about 4 different sizes, but, personally, only one makes these earphones any good in terms of sound quality, i.e. the largest size.-I find these hard to put on. Part of the reason why this is the case is because the buttons that control it are pretty much all the places you want to put your fingers in trying to put these on your ears. It’s very hard to try and put these on without accidentally pressing a button and music starting to play prematurely.-I had read before receiving these that they do get uncomfortable after a while, and they really do—especially in one ear (for me, it’s the right ear). My ears will also start itching after a while, and I have to take these out to scratch and then struggle to put them back on (see my previous point).-You better stick with and use your case with these, because these could be really easy to lose and the ear cups can easily come off if you are very mobile. I have to fight the urge to just place these on my bed sometimes, knowing they can easily go bye bye that way. I don’t love the idea of always needing to carry a case around with these or always leaving them in my ears just to make sure I can keep up with them. This is where wired earphones that don’t have changeable cups are better.-Because they operate via bluetooth, often when you go to the next song the first second or two of the song is cut off. I have the same issue with some other bluetooth speakers, and it’s something that caused me to stop using them. Very annoying.Those are my biggest cons with them, although there are others that are probably more specific annoyances to me.Pros:-If you have an iPhone or iPad, it will show on the screen how much charge your case and your earphones have. Love this feature.-The charge is pretty long-lasting for both the case and the earphones. Have not had to charge the case since getting these a few days ago, and that charge is still well over 50%.-Best bass in a pair of earphones, if you have the right size ear cups on.-Easier to pair with your devices (and easier to use) than most of the cheap wireless earbuds I’ve seen, but especially if you have an iPhone or iPad.-Overall, the sound quality is good, especially for earphones—it’s just the mids that are not perfect, but it seems like no earphones are perfect unless you’re the type who hates bass...in that case, you can find many “perfect” earphones.-They do stay in place, unlike other earphones. Very big deal!-The controls do a lot and are fairly easy to learn and to use, although not totally perfect.I do want to caution that I order from Amazon a ton, and when I ordered these for a Christmas present for myself (someone else paid, so it was really a gift from them), Amazon’s delivery truck “lost” them after showing my house was the next stop for them to deliver these. I have never had a lost package from Amazon, especially when UPS or USPS delivers. I had to order from Walmart before getting my Amazon refund to get this by Christmas. I just think it’s odd that the first time I order an expensive, popular electronic device and it’s Christmas time, Amazon’s drivers suddenly lose my order on the way to my house.

R3AQHZ5W95PLS9,B07R5QD598,5.0 out of 5 stars One of my best purchases,Michelle Benoit,5,"I had a bad experience with the original Powerbeats, but found myself drawn to the Powerbeats Pro. I contemplated getting either those or AirPods. Despite many people saying it wasn’t a problem, I didn’t like that the AirPods simply went into my ear without any way to secure them. I lift weights, and the last thing I wanted was for one of them to pop out at an inopportune time. I also didn’t like the fact that there was no volume control on the AirPods. The Powerbeats Pro allow me to adjust the volume from BOTH earpieces. That way if my right hand is occupied, I can adjust the volume with my left hand, or vice versa. Here are my pros and cons.Pros: #1 These headphones last a pretty long time on a full charge. They don’t last as long if you’re using them for a phone call, but if you’re simply listening to music, you will get 5+ hours out of them. #2 Again, I love that I can adjust the volume, start, stop, repeat or skip a song directly on my earpiece, rather than having to reach for my phone, which is often buried at the bottom of my bag. #3 I’m sure the AirPods do this as well, but I love how the Powerbeats Pro integrate with Siri once you allow the right settings. I don’t even need to touch my phone or my earpiece, I can simply say “Hey Siri” and ask the time, the weather, what a word means, have someone on my contact list called or messaged, etc.Cons: #1 I wish the earpieces were truly adjustable. They don't come with different sizes of inner-ear pads, and the over-the-ear hooks don’t adjust as much as I would like. At times they can feel uncomfortable and somewhat painful. #2 I learned the hard way that despite it being an added burden, it might be a good idea to take the charging case with you when you leave the house. I’ve been out while all of a sudden, one of my headphones stops working despite having a substantial charge. The only way to reconnect both pieces is to place them back in the carrying case and re-pair. #3 Sometimes if you don’t sit the headphones onto the charging prongs correctly, one (or both) might not properly charge. That can be very frustrating when you’re ready to use them. When you go to Bluetooth settings on your phone and first connect them, sometimes a box will pop up letting you know how much power is left in the case, as well as the charges on the earpieces. If you pull only one of the earpieces out, it will tell you the charge of each piece individually. Unfortunately I don’t always receive that dialog box, which is very helpful.Overall, I absolutely LOVE my Powerbeats Pro, and they are certainly one of my favorite and most satisfactory purchases. In fact, I love them so much that I own two pairs of headphones and alternate between both. I like throwing one into my gym bag as a backup, just in case I need it.","Reviewed in the United States August 8, 2021",AEDCHMFS55CNEVNVFN7JVEQVYZSA,True,2,Color: BlackStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+

At first I thought, what is wrong with these I just got these and the battery seems to only last 2 hours, well I looked back at my history and realized I've actually had these for 4 years and I use them A LOT! I love to have them in while I'm working and listen to YouTube or TV or just talk to a friend so I can still work with my hands. I walk the dog and talk with my mom, or whatever it is, I'm multi-tasking but recently realized these Beats are dying on me. So I thought it was good that these have lasted me almost 4 years. Is that good? Electronics don't seem to last as long as they used to. These are comfortable and have definitely stood up to a lot of use. Friends have told me that Apple iPods don't last this long, so I think I'm going to get myself another pair of these Beats.

R2Q1CA4D9VFS5C,B07R5QD598,4.0 out of 5 stars Good,Tim,4,"I've had these almost 2 years now. They're good headphones and are worth the price when on sale if you're an Apple user.Comfort is important since I bought them for working out and walks and I have no major complaints there. These are pretty lightweight despite the large package and stay in the ear well. I don't have any issues wearing these for a few hours. I also appreciate the hardware buttons: one large button for play/pause and skip, and dedicated volume up/down buttons on each ear! The misguided crusade against buttons has condemned many wireless headphones to unreliable and hard to use touch interfaces and the Powerbeats Pro are fortunately not part of this trend.They're not the best sounding headphones ever, I've used (wired) IEMs that cost less than half what these do and sound better. But you don't buy wireless headphones for audiophile purposes. Audio quality is fine and doesn't actively annoy me, so they pass. There is no built in noise canceling so if you want that you're probably better off with some newer headphones.Battery life is good enough for my purposes. I don't think I've ever actually tested the claimed 9 hours since I prefer full sized headphones for real extended listening, but haven't had issues using for over 5 hours on a single charge. Now, one my biggest issue with these is with the design of the case: even after this long time using the Powerbeats it can be hard to get them to sit in the case properly so that both earbuds charge. It can be a nasty surprise to put your headphones in to charge overnight and discover the next day that one ear is dead instead of charged. You need to check the battery widget on your phone to make sure it indicates both ears are charging, and then be gentle so that the snap of the case closing doesn't knock one of the earbuds loose. As you might have guessed, carrying the case around while charging can be problematic. There are magnets that are supposed to hold the headphones in place but they don't seem to be strong enough to do the job.Now the main reason these are better than other, maybe cheaper wireless headphones is the superior integration with Apple. As someone who hops between iPhone and Android, I can say there's unfortunately no better bluetooth connectivity available than there is between iPhones and headphones with the H1 chip. When I use non-Apple headphones I never feel fully confident taking them out of the case to take an incoming call, because there's a decent chance they either won't connect without fiddling with the Bluetooth menu or the glitchiness of the connection process will drop the call (particularly on Android) or drop me into the call sounding like a robot. With the Powerbeats Pro I don't feel that nervousness grabbing them to take a call. Bluetooth still isn't as reliable as plugging into a headphone jack (remember those?) but iPhone with H1 based headphones is as close as you can get.","Reviewed in the United States July 31, 2021",AHU6Z4ZEM2QWYMI2YXBXXB7YPZJA,True,1,Color: BlackStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+

I’ve had airpods, airpod pros, random off brand wireless earbuds, and have always end up going back to my beats headphones because nothing would stay on. I unfortunately had to retire my headphones for now since I got my ears pierced and don’t want to risk discomfort with pressure or them, but these earbuds fit perfectly!! I could wear them on hour long runs without them slipping out, only with mild discomfort after about an hour of wear. My other issue is that my headphones were pretty soundproof, but you can hear pretty much any noise with these on. Still great and worth the price if you ask me, considering no other earbuds fit me! Even shockz headphones were a bit off fitting.","Reviewed in the United States January 29, 2024",AGQSALCG2JVGYODRJ5H7TN4B52SQ,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: Powerbeats ProSet: Without AppleCare+

I was hesitant to buy these because some reviews listed the charging case as flimsy, its not as sturdy as airpod case, but quality seems decent, and case is a little to big for my liking, but quality of the earphones make up for it and then some.

R3O2F0G4RQELXK,B09JL41N9C,5.0 out of 5 stars Movement focused TW earbuds from Beats with great sound,Ant,5,"My pair of Beats Powerbeats Pros were starting to die out on me. I had purchased them secondhand so I wasn’t too upset, but I needed a replacement. I decided to get a new pair of true wireless earbuds this time around.After doing some research on the top recommended workout focused true wireless earbuds, it came down to the Beats Fit Pro and the Beats Studio Buds.Ultimately I decided on the more expensive of the two, thinking it would be worth the extra cost. I got them on a sale that was running here which makes it even better. My use case for them would be for gym workouts such as jogging/walking and lifting, and also for casual use at work and home.I’ve had this pair for a little over 1 year and 6 months. I have purchased Apple care + for them but have not had to use it.EXPERIENCE:The sound on these, personally, is really enjoyable! The noise cancelling and transparency mode work so well.If I’m at the gym and don’t want to hear the other people making noise with their machines or the running of treadmills? Turn on noise cancelling and have music on. In a snap, the outside noises seem to be gone.At work and don’t want to miss a phone call?Turn on transparency mode and you’re free to hear sounds around you. Even better with just one earbud in, too.The mic quality on calls seems to be passable, people seem to hear me fine.*Small note: there is a tiny rip in the silicone/plastic on the right bud’s button near the bottom. I suspect this is from wearing them when going to bed sometimes. I usually wake up and find them out of my ears. There are times where they’re still in my ears, but I tend to move around during when asleep.OTHER THOUGHTS:I really like the wing tips on the earbuds, they stay in my ears perfectly. Sure, there was some soreness in my ears in the beginning, but my ears got used to it pretty fast. Also, the ear tip size helps a lot. Make sure you try all the included sizes to really figure out which one is most comfortable.There is definitely a learning curve on inserting the earbuds into your ears. Once you get the method of inserting them smoothly and creating the right seal, they are more enjoyable. Look at one of the animations in the earbud’s description for reference.Plus, the sage grey colorway just looks dope. Wish there was a lava red colorway available like the Powerbeats Pro.These work great with my iPhone and connected to my PC. Can’t speak for performance on an Android device. I am perfectly happy with this purchase!(Pictured is the earbuds, with an aftermarket cover on the case to protect from accidental damage)","Reviewed in the United States March 8, 2024",AFHZTD2L5OXDW2RC4GDSIBRMAB6A,True,53,Color: Sage GrayStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+
R35IQTO062Y7LU,B09JL41N9C,5.0 out of 5 stars Best wireless noise cancelling earbuds I have used so far,theInternational,5,"I am a long-time user of the Bose QuietComfort 20 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones. These are my favorite noise cancelling option to use while taking walks. I like to listen to audio books while walking and the QuietComfort 20 are superb for this use. I also like to use a noise cancelling option while listening to audio books and podcasts in the car, especially because my car does not contain road noise well. I decided I would like to have a second QuietComfort 20 reserved for use in my car. An additional advantage to having a second one is if anything happens to the one I walk with, I'll have a backup. But, unfortunately, Bose discontinued the QuietComfort 20 forcing me to have to find another option for use in the car.I first purchased the wireless Bose QuietComfort Earbuds. But I found much to dislike about them. They feel heavy in the ears; the buds themselves just feel heavier and less comfortable than the QuietComfort 20 Headphones. I also disliked that every time I put the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds into my ears they speak to me telling me they are trying to connect to my device and also reporting battery state. I found this incredibly annoying. Another thing I hugely disliked was that there is an uncomfortable ""boom boom"" sensation as I walk with them in. I wear Vibram FiveFinger shoes and do not walk with a heavy gait. I do not get this ""boom boom"" sensation when walking with the QuietComfort 20 headphones. I also disliked how big the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds' case was. I disliked how the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds sometimes felt like they weren't secure in my ears and when I would try to adjust their stability I would accidentally change the noise cancellation setting. On two occasions, an uncomfortable high pitched sound emitted from one of the buds; it only lasted for a couple seconds but it was annoying. I tried using the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds for a month and never could bring myself to like them, so I returned them. I now have a strong dislike for Bose, primarily because they discontinued my beloved QuietComfort 20 Headphones. But up until recently, I was a huge Bose fan.I purchased Apple AirPods Pro. I immediately fell in love with the H1 chip operation. But I didn't like the color white. I also didn't like the stalk that extends down. But I started using them thinking I had found my noise cancelling option for the car. And although the AirPods Pro delivered some ""boom boom"" sensation while walking, it was much much better than the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds. Then I started to become aware of a huge problem with the AirPods Pro. They would not stay in my ears. I would place them in ear, hear the noise cancellation activate and then in time the noise cancellation would turn off because one of the pods had pushed out of my ear enough to cause the noise cancellation function to disengage. I found myself constantly having to push them into my ear in an effort to keep them from pushing out. A couple times they plain fell out of my ears. I consulted instructionals on how to properly insert them into my ears for proper fit. I also did the fit test and passed the test indicating I had good seal. Only the seal wouldn't last and the pods would eventually push out of my ears. So I had to return the AirPods Pro because they wouldn't stay in my ears.I purchased some non noise cancelling earbuds thinking that a passive seal would be enough, but I found a number of problems with this option. I didn't like shoving thing way into my ear. Not only was it a little uncomfortable, but I also wondered about the sanitariness of touching (e.g., foam inserts) prior to shoving them into my ear. Maybe this could lead to ear infection? Also, the amount of sound isolation was too good which diminished my situational awareness while walking and/or driving. So passive noise block earbuds weren't solving my use need.I was worried there was no option for the car and I would not have a backup to my beloved QuietComfort 20 headphones. I really wish I could buy another pair of QuietComfort 20 headphones just to have a backup for the future. After delaying and delaying, I decided to go to the trouble to try one last option for the car: the Beats Fit Pro. Eureka!The Beats Fit Pro are fantastic! They have the H1 chip, which is awesome. They fit and feel way better than the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds and are super secure in my ears, unlike the AirPods Pro. The Beats Fit Pro feel so light to wear. I can wear them all day and there is no discomfort. They also have a button to cycle through the noise cancellation options, which I like a lot better than the tapping that was needed on the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds. I also like the button press on the Beats Fit Pro better than the stalk-squeeze on the AirPods Pro.The one edge that I might say the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds have over the others is the noise cancellation. The Bose QuietComfort Earbuds arguably provide more intense noise cancellation that results in more of a bass presence and a sense that the content being played is closer to you. However, there is a cost to this that I don't think is worth it. The biggest cost for me was the ""boom boom"" sensation while walking. I don't know exactly what is to blame for this but it completely ruins the earbuds for what I want to use them for. I found the fit and noise cancellation of the Beats Fit Pro to be better suited to my needs.I wrote this to help others in their quest to find the earbuds that work best for them. I strongly recommend giving the Beats Fit Pro a try. I like them a lot. I think many others will too.ADDENDUM (added 2022-NOV): My beloved wired Bose QuietComfort 20 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones stopped working a few weeks ago. I purchased the wired Bose Headphones many, many years ago and used them a lot, so it was not unexpected. Fortunately, the Beats Fit Pro have been able to replace the wired Headphones for my daily walks. The Beats Fit Pro have minimal ""boom boom"" sensation while stepping/walking. Although the Beats Fit Pro have more ""boom boom"" than the wired Bose Headphones, the ""boom boom"" is minimal and much, much better than offered by the wireless Bose QuietComfort Earbuds. I have been using the Beats Fit Pro in cold weather lately and discovered that the physical side button on the Beats Fit Pro works fantastically when wearing a hat. For example, if I am wearing a thick knit winter hat, I can still activate the side button on the Beats Fit Pro by pushing on the outside of the hat. This can't be done with a touch-operation ""button"" like found on the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds. The AirPods Pro ""button"" might be more difficult to operate with a hat on too. So if you are intending to use earbuds under a hat or hood, Beats Fit Pro will give you the advantage of still having full, easy use of the side button for play/pause operation from outside the hat.","Reviewed in the United States July 13, 2022",AHJD4656VLR6I3TCW544TITKJBUQ,True,734,Color: Sage GrayStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+
R2LFEEQXQDETXR,B09JL41N9C,4.0 out of 5 stars Good Apple Ecosystem Option for Running,C. Godby,4,"Before buying the Beats Fit Pro, I've owned the PowerBeats Pro and AirPods Pro 2. I'm a runner that wants an Apple ecosystem option that has decent sound quality and won't fall out of my ear. After two runs and a trip to the gym, I'm happy with them so far. Out of the three options above, I consider them the best option for running. My quick thoughts on each:The PowerBeats Pro has been out for two or three years now and I'm surprised there hasn't been an updated model. They're good earbuds for runners...when they work. And the when they work part is infuriating. The earbuds have to line up perfectly with the charging connections in the case or they won't charge. I can't tell you how many times I've gone to use them and found one fully charged and the other dead. There was even a potential class action lawsuit filed against Apple on that (search for it). When they work, the PowerBeats Pro are solid because they hook around your ear. You can have confidence when you run they're not going to fall out - I never had an issue in the two years or so I owned them with that. There is also a physical button for changing songs and pausing the music and a rocker for changing the volume, which is convenient. Cons: sound quality is ho hum in my opinion - it never feels like they secure cleanly in your ear. Also, there's no wireless charging or noise cancellation. Oh, and of course the infuriating charging issues. I would not buy the PowerBeats Pro again for that reason.On to the AirPods Pro 2. These earbuds have better sound quality in my opinion than both the PowerBeats Pro and Beats Fit Pro. The noise cancellation meaningfully improved from gen 1 to gen 2. There's wireless charging and a speaker installed in the case so you can ping them using the ""find my"" app on your iPhone. For day to day use around the home or office, these earbuds are awesome. However, at least for me, they're not for running. While more secure than the regular AirPods, they still fall out of my ears sometimes and that certainly applies to running. If you buy after market rubber hooks, Air Pods Pro 2 (and 1) will stay secure when running and provide a good experience (they don't fall out). That said, having to attach the rubber hooks each time you go to run is a pain in the butt.The Beats Fit Pro makes some compromises, but in my opinion it's the best option for runners based on my limited experience so far. The rubber wing tips ensure that the Beats Fit Pro has a secure fit in your ear. They've felt secure running and haven't fallen out in my experience so far. There's a physical button for changing the song, activating noise cancellation, and pausing the music. Versus the PowerBeats Pro, there's no rubber hook so they're not as secure and there's no volume rocker. However, they do have noise cancellation and fit more snugly in your ear. As a result, I think the sound quality is a little better than the PowerBeats Pro, but not as good as the AirPods Pro 2. On the downside, I think the case feels cheap compared to the AirPods, there's no wireless charging, and there's no speaker on the case for the ""find my"" app. In addition, the case charges using USB C instead of lightning (btw, it's a USB C to USB C cable included with them and there's no power brick included). USB C is coming to iPhone and I believe is already on iPad, but it's irritating that it has a USB C cable instead of lightning when your life revolves around lightning cables.In short, avoid the Powerbeats Pro - the charging issue is a design flaw and will lead to frustration over time. The AirPods Pro 2 are awesome, but they're not a good option for running since they will fall out of many people's ears. The Beats Fit Pro makes compromises, but in my experience so far its the best Apple ecosystem earbud for running.","Reviewed in the United States February 8, 2023",AHYLFTWLZ5YY5FWN3UBI4YSR3ROQ,True,225,Color: Beats BlackStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+
R2JXCMRVKF84KR,B09JL41N9C,5.0 out of 5 stars Elevating the Listening Experience,Kailash,5,"I recently had the pleasure of trying out the Beats Fit Pro True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds, and I must say, I am thoroughly impressed with their performance. These earbuds offer a premium listening experience that elevates every moment, whether I'm working out, commuting, or simply relaxing at home.One of the standout features of these earbuds is their impressive noise cancellation capabilities. They effectively block out external distractions, allowing me to immerse myself fully in my music or podcasts without any interruptions. This is particularly useful when I'm in noisy environments like the gym or on public transportation.Additionally, the sound quality of the Beats Fit Pro earbuds is exceptional. The audio is crisp, clear, and well-balanced, with deep bass and detailed highs that make every song come to life. Whether I'm listening to my favorite tracks or taking calls, the sound quality never disappoints.I also appreciate the comfortable and secure fit of these earbuds. The ergonomic design and multiple ear tip options ensure a snug and stable fit, even during vigorous exercise or movement. Plus, they are sweat and water-resistant, making them perfect for workouts or outdoor activities.The battery life of the Beats Fit Pro earbuds is also impressive, with up to 6 hours of listening time on a single charge and an additional 18 hours provided by the charging case. This means I can enjoy uninterrupted music throughout the day without worrying about running out of battery.Overall, I cannot recommend the Beats Fit Pro True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds enough. Their premium sound quality, effective noise cancellation, comfortable fit, and long battery life make them a top choice for anyone in search of high-quality wireless earbuds. Whether you're a music lover, fitness enthusiast, or frequent traveler, these earbuds are sure to enhance your listening experience.","Reviewed in the United States March 21, 2024",AG77DIMEIWDUUMGCBEAOODGVITPA,True,5,Color: Tidal BlueStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+

I’m very physically active and any time I start moving and sweating I’ve had issues with earbuds falling out. These stayed put and the sound quality is fantastic. The plus about these is that they are push as opposed touch active. Most earbuds that you have to touch or tap to answer a call or pause music are way too sensitive. With these being push/press active, gives a little more control. They are higher in price but they are worth it based on the quality, and performance. I will say that I did wish the battery life was a little longer but that’s minor considering I can make it almost a whole shift before I have put them in the case to charge. The only thing I really don’t like is the case. It does seem a bit flimsy and like if dropped without a protective case, it would crack or the hinge part can break easy.","Reviewed in the United States June 29, 2024",AFQSGQMILO5JRG227KEVUHWQKOOA,True,0,Color: Stone PurpleStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+
REDXSAP527XVD,B09JL41N9C,5.0 out of 5 stars Compared to 4 other Earbuds...,Connor,5,"I bought these earbuds along with 4 other pairs, with the intent of comparing them over a couple weeks and returning all but my favorite. Here were the results:Beats Fit Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JL65GNM?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – These buds had some great base, and the wingtip gave them a fit that made them refuse to fall out of my ears. But the best feature? Physical “clicky” buttons on each one of the buds. You press in and hear/feel the click, rather than relying on a touchscreen-like feature. No need to guess if you tapped them once or twice, you will know.Cons – The wingtip gives a very sturdy fit, but not the most comfortable. I wouldn’t recommend to anyone with smaller ears. The noise canceling was solid, but nothing special. And this may be picky, but I didn’t care for most of the color schemes available. I prefer my earbuds to be hard to notice, and even the black ones have a bright red letter “b” in the middle.Beats Studio Buds - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096SV8SJG?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – Very comfortable with the same great physically “clicky” buttons as the Beats Fit Pro. Noise canceling seemed slightly better than average. Great base. Classic look.Cons – Tested during a workout, a little bit of sweat had these sliding right out of my ear. The case for these earbuds also was the flimsiest of any I had tested, with a very weak hinge that I was scared of breaking off within the 2 weeks of using.Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MWZHHKP?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – A neat feature that I noticed only in these earbuds was that it had noise amplification as well as noise cancelation. With one swipe in the app, the surrounding sound was actually louder and clearer than it would be without the earbuds in. Great if you are hard of hearing, or just enjoy snooping on conversations out of reach.Cons – Similar to the Beats Studio Buds, these didn’t stay in during a workout. They were usable, but every 10 minutes I found myself pushing them back into my ear. And this is an opinion, but these are the ugliest earbuds out of the bunch. The shiny black gleam made it look like a large beetle was hanging out in my ear. No visible brand placement either, which makes them appear cheap and generic rather than the quality Samsung they are.Samsung Galaxy Buds Live - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09TBM1L3S?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – Cost effective! I added these to the test group because of the unique shape, and for that they are worth giving a try. If you have small ears and do not like the rubber insert that is standard in most other earbuds, these may be perfect for you.Cons – Poor fit for large ears. These were tested the least of all of the buds, because the fit was so bad for my ear shape that they wouldn’t stay in if I turned my head too fast.Bose QuietComfort - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C4KWM9T?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – Bose noise canceling is unmatched. If your primary use for earbuds is to cancel out that background white noise, this is the pair for you. The sound quality is great, not too heavy on the base. The case for the earbuds stood out from the rest as the only one that impressed me. Felt very study, and I had no worries tossing it into a gym bag or cup holder. The only case with a button latch to make sure it doesn’t open accidentally.Cons – This was the most expensive pair of earbuds by a longshot, and there were still some things I felt could be improved. The rubber inserts had more of a “flayed” shape rather than the “rounded” shape that is standard. My guess is that this was by design, because the earbuds were also slightly heavier than others and may need that extra in-ear grip. The flayed shape did make them sturdier, but at the cost of them being uncomfortable in an active situation. They were also the largest earbuds, and stuck out from the side of my head further than I would have liked.My favorite? The beats fit pro! While I wouldn’t recommend this pair for everyone, it was perfect for my routine. My music taste benefits from the boosted base, and the wingtip shape was perfect for any workouts. The feature that really convinced me was the physical buttons, something that I didn’t realize how desperately I needed.","Reviewed in the United States August 11, 2022",AFEITP6Y25NKH3KB2LXWQCC7STIA,True,476,Color: Sage GrayStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+

R3OU5G5RXBTK3T,B09JL41N9C,"5.0 out of 5 stars Finally, Something By Beats I Can Endorse",Jeff Gomske,5,"I work in radio. I've done it for 30+ years and one of the curses/blessings of working with audio is I have grown to understand intimately what really good audio sounds like. I have used countless number of headphones and earbuds (and there 𝙄𝙎 a difference between the two) and there are a few names which stand above the rest, and I'm not going to get into a debate because so-called, 'Audiophiles' will claim they know better (Which begs the question, how does one actually 𝙗𝙚𝙘𝙤𝙢𝙚 an Audiophile in the first place? Is there a course you can take, or does one simply give themselves that title? But I digress...) when Beats first hit the scene, they were unquestionably an astonishing waste of money. Their audio quality was maybe a shade above average at best. But, that didn't stop millions of people from buying them at outrageous prices. Well, the uncontested King of over-priced products (apple) got wind of this and did a takeover of their products and an interesting thing happened: their quality got BETTER.Did they become as good as most ""professional"" headphones out there...? Probably not. However, their earbuds did become notably better. I feel it necessary to point out that while Beats headphones were nowhere as good as many claimed, their earbuds from the beginning seemed to be pretty good from the get-go. Their unique ""hook"" style which wrapped around your ear for a secure fit (you either love this style or not - but you cannot argue that they did not fit and stay in place better than almost any other brand out there). Some of their other wired earbuds were still decent as well, if not priced at the upper end of what most people were willing to pay, but at least the earbuds could be counted on to give you an above average experience.Apple buys them out and reorganizes the entire company. Suddenly they are no longer all over the place like they used to be. Famous people were no longer wearing them everywhere you looked. Then apple releases their Beats branded earbuds, the Powerbeats Pro. Love them or hate them, they made an impact.They were also equipped with apple tech like their H1 chip which made them instantly compatible with iPhones (a pretty smart move, actually) and the audio was excellent, especially for working out. Then they release the Beats Fit Pro.A radically different design. But - a welcome one, especially for someone who loved the Powerbeats great audio quality, but not the hook design. Again, it's hard to please everyone when it comes to something that fits inside your ears that have so many different possible sizes and an almost infinite number of differences from one person to the next...like the apple airpods, one size fit 𝙢𝙤𝙨𝙩...and if you were one of the people they did not fit, well you were kind of SOL. At least with the Fit Pro they opened up better fitting to a much larger segment than the airpods and with the included wing-tip design, they immediately caught the eye of many athletes who need earbuds which stay put while sometimes being fairly aggressive in their workouts. If you were not a fan of the Powerbeats hook style, the Fit Pro's must have looked like a gift from On High.FIrst off, they really DO sound great. Good bass without going too deep. Music NEEDS good bass, but if it thumps too hard, it will ruin audio in more ways than I can describe here. Mids and Highs were also both pretty crisp and not overly isolated. The blend just works. Whoever tuned the Fit Pro should be commended for doing such a great job.ANC was...disappointing. To be fair, to get great ANC into such a tiny device really IS a challenge and oftentimes going all-in on this feature usually means you sacrifice audio quality. In this case, Beats chose to put more into the audio than into the ANC. I had a difficult time even recognizing that it was even turned on at all. Maybe my pair simply isn't doing it's job. However, the OnePlus buds Z2 has ANC that is actually pretty good and still has really impressive audio as well, so I'm not exactly sure why the Fit Pro's is so difficult to even tell if ANC is on or off, but I can only review what I have and that seems to be the case with my particular pair.The wing-tip design really works well - for me at least. They provide a pretty good fit and they stay put incredibly well. My biggest problem with earbuds is exactly that. Either they'll fit well, or almost not at all. It doesn't seem to fall anywhere in between. My OnePlus buds Z2 sound great, but I constantly find myself adjusting them in my ears - which honestly is annoying. The Fit Pro's (at least in my case) I set them in, twist to secure the wing-tip and they just stay put. This is going to be subjective since everyone is slightly different, so keep in mind my experience with how they fit in my ear may not mirror your own.You can do a little customizing with the app. I do have an iPhone but I primarily use an android, so I downloaded the app and you can to a bit of customizing, however, not as much as I would have liked to have seen given what these earbuds are capable of. I believe the iPhone integration has quite a bit more options than the android counterpart. This seems to be more the norm these days as apple and Samsung work hard to reward you for buying products that are more in line with their products than the competition. I wish they'd both put an end to this childish bickering and open up all their products that can be used on other platforms to include all the options that they would have if you paired it with an iPhone or a Samsung. Either you want your customers to get the best bang for their buck or not.I like the physical buttons the Fit Pro uses. You'll know by touch that you've pressed it instead of simply the ""touch"" controls which in my experience can be hit or miss. When they work great, it's awesome. But do they all work perfectly every time? Of course not. With buttons, they seem to work pretty much 100% of the time and that's something I appreciate.No wireless charging. At this point, especially for the cost, that really is something they should have included. Is it a deal breaker? For some it very well could be. It wasn't for me, but I love wireless charging and think every pair of wireless earbuds over $100 really ought to include it. I know earbuds that cost under $40 that do, so to not include it here seems to be almost an insult. They use USB-C charging which IS convenient however. Beats claims they have fast charging however, in fact they call it ""Fast Fuel"" where just 5 minutes of charging will net you an hour of listening...I haven't been able to check this, but I CAN state that they do seem to charge pretty quick, so that may negate some of the disappointment of not having wireless ability, but necessarily so.The case is pretty nice, too. It is quite a bit smaller than the case for the Powerbeats, but still larger than what you get with the airpods. I honestly didn't mind the size at all, so this one is also going to be pretty subjective.For the most part, these are the first apple made earbuds that I can recommend even if you own an android device. The audio is stellar and they seem to hold a charge for about an average length of time for earbuds of this size. I rarely listen for more than about an hour, maybe 2 at the most, so I'm not the guy to look for with advice on listening at length (unless it's for headphones, then I can make a LOT of recommendations). Honestly, I'm happy with mine. Are they perfect? No. But are they worth it? I sure think so.***UPDATE***I purchased some memory foam eartips...not sure that this was a wise decision. Not because they don't work or fit well, but because they are slightly larger, it means fitting them back into the charging case either they won't charge or they'll be problematic to fit properly. Now, in all fairness, this wasn't an issue with the smallest foam eartips, but the medium and larger ones did not like to fit back into the case. They also did not really make any noticeable difference is audio quality, so I switched back to the original tips they came with. Lesson learned.","Reviewed in the United States March 22, 2023",AHJED44JHCW4ATDA2K2MQRWPZQ7A,True,557,Color: Volt YellowStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+
R14J76DRBT8EHE,B09JL41N9C,"4.0 out of 5 stars Wonderful sound quality, great features, but missing one important feature",J. Sierra,4,"I'll start by stating that I appreciate and recognize great quality audio, and certainly prefer the highest quality audio that I can reasonably get when I'm listening to headphones and/or earbuds. That being said, the important word here is ""reasonably"", and I don't have tremendous expectations from earbuds that are also intended for working out, etc. it's just not reasonable to expect to compare them to over-ear headphones, in terms of quality or features. Noise cancellation, bass response, highs, mids.... Over-ear are always going to edge out earbuds. There's just more space to make it all work.Ok that's out of the way. I didn't have huge expectations and I wasn't even convinced that the buds would be worth the $150 (they were on sale when I bought them.) I'm not convinced *any* ear bud is worth more than $100, and I've tried some very ""high-end"" units.So I pulled the trigger with some hesitation, received them, charged them up, paired em to my phone after downloading the proprietary Beats app (didn't like that, but there's good news), popped em in (after trying the different sized ends) and went on a run (because I feel like that constant bouncing is the likeliest to cause them to fall out.)I was.... Extremely surprised. Surprised and a little impressed. Sound quality is actually really, really good... Far better than I would've expected from a Beats product, more akin to the high quality Sony and Technics units. There are two ""modes"", sound-cancelling and transparency mode (transparency mode allows for awareness of what's going on around you by almost enhancing ambient noise.) Noise cancellation is surprisingly good, though yes, okay, not the absolute best I've heard but it's in the top 3 for ear buds, no question. It's effective, even if it eats battery up like crazy. I appreciate transparency mode though - especially while running or biking. It's not disturbing to have the ambient noise available and there's a safety component there that can't be overstated. And it works really well.Pairing them up was a little... Interesting. They're clearly designed by and for Apple people, so if you're rocking that Apple tech the process is probably mostly automated (that's as advertised) but with Android you theoretically have you use a Beats app. At first that aggravated me (I really hate proprietary apps) but then the pairing failed and I discovered that I could indeed pair via Bluetooth, it's super fast and easy, and the Beats app just gives me a handy place to activate some features/controls. I can't speak to the Apple experience though.Charging is where I was actually disappointed enough to take a star off the product. The case is ok, has cool little magnets to keep the buds in place, but it only works as a charging station when plugged in. No wireless charging. That's a huge miss for Beats. Huge. There are a ton of comparable products at that price profile and all of them offer wireless charging. It's maybe not a deal breaker and they do have ok battery life but it's... Extremely disappointing. Battery life is going to depend a lot on whether you use noise cancellation or not. Kind of a big fluctuation there, ymmv, maybe not the best but definitely far from the worst. They certainly last well beyond exercise sessions, and are capable of giving most of your day music. Again though, lack of wireless charging is blatantly, conspicuously missing. And it's annoying because if it had wireless charging the battery life would almost become inconsequential. Fortunately, thanks to Amazon, there are actually aftermarket cases that do have wireless charging, giving you approximately three days worth of charge. It's an extra thirty bucks so it's something you'll want to keep in mind/consider as part of ownership. Don't get me wrong, it's not a deal breaker - there's plenty of battery life - but it's one of those things that premium buds should have. Period. And these are supposed to be premium buds.The fit is exceptionally comfortable. There are several tips that help with sealing but also support the stability in the ear while doing exercise. After a run/jog session they stayed in without any issues. Even with plenty of sweat, they were good to go. The extra little fin protrusion also contributed effectively to it staying in and in place. I would have been more surprised at this but I've been using ear bud hearing protection recently and they're so light and well fitting that I know what good buds are capable of in this particular domain.The features are actually pretty neat, but mostly expected, like swapping automatically from buds to phone and back again, going single-bud with nary a hiccup, and plenty more. They're pretty slick in functionality. The buttons are also tactile, providing a neat click; seems like a little thing but from an interface perspective it's a surprisingly big deal, and it works really well.So, are they good? I think that they're overpriced but I think all ear buds these days are so, grain of salt. I think they're very very good buds, they exceeded my admittedly mid expectations, they function flawlessly and most importantly: they deliver great sound. Would I buy them for two bills? Eh.... Knowing what I know now about them and how good they are, that goes from a hard no to a soft maybe. At $150ish I think they're a decent value. Are they better than over ear options? Not in terms of sheer quality no, but: they're a million times better for exercise and working out. Unless you like being one of those douchey gym rats with the Beats over-ear. Then I can't help you.For the rest of us, these are a very fine choice. Sony and Technics have offerings that actually do have intensely high quality audio, but these come close enough in terms of audio and they're good for a sweaty, bouncy, jouncy session of your favorite exercise, whatever that might be.As always, ymmv. But hey, with Amazon if you don't like em, you can just return them. Hopefully my review helped a little.Merry Christmas!","Reviewed in the United States December 26, 2023",AHG4U7VZCV63NJNZUKLWXRXUFIKQ,True,22,Color: Sage GrayStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+

Gulley,5,"I rarely write reviews, but when I find a product that not only does what it is supposed to do, but exceeds what is advertised, I must spred the word.I have tried many ear buds, both wired and wireless with little satisfaction. I am hard of hearing and I miss many of the high notes, even with my hearing aids on. The Beats Fit Pro are not hearing aids, but I am hearing highs that I haven't herd in years. My hearing aids cost me more than $3000. and listening to music with the beats is much clearer than my expensive aids. The highs are crisp and clear and base i nearly perfect. I havent been this impressed with a product in years. If you are an Apple user, then you are in for an added bonus as the Beats Fit Pro takes advantage of many of Iphone, Ipad, and Mac features. My only wish is that the battery would last a little longer as I like to sleep wearing them. The 7 hours isn't quite long enough for all night use, but close enough. Some wirless buds will last longer on a single charge, but at the expense of sound quality. The price currently is just slightly higher than many of the off brand buds and is worth every penny. The Beats Fit Pro are great, best purchase I have made on line in a very long time.","Reviewed in the United States June 19, 2024",AFBTTTNRF6WHC4KLRHJEG7XXMTFA,True,3,Color: Sage GrayStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+
R3BJQEGT2UE1HS,B09JL41N9C,4.0 out of 5 stars Better than Apple AirPod Pro,P.S.,4,"After my Apple AirPods stopped working, I was looking for a replacement and found these. Since they work with the Apple ecosystem, I figured I’d give them a shot. I bought them on sale and was floored by the noise cancellation and comfort. I hated the AirPods how they’d move if knocked around a little bit. A year later the Beats battery life shortened and one ear bud would not charge as fast as the other so I threw them away and bought a new pair. It’s now been a year later with the new set and they’re doing the same thing. It frustrates me because I love these, but they seem to be only good for a year.I decided to buy a pair of Apple AirPod Pros in hopes that maybe they’d be the new replacement. I didn’t like the odd fit they have, but thought I’d live with it if they were better, but the sound quality was so tinny compared to the Beats that I returned them the next day. Maybe it was a bad pair of AirPod Pros, but I couldn’t believe the difference in sound quality. I’ll gives these another month and buy them again, but with Apple Care so they can be replaced after they stop charging properly.These are great earbuds, but only if you get Apple Care and know you’ll have to replace them every year.","Reviewed in the United States June 18, 2024",AG7G3DOT5A47QVQHQS7DF33SBI2A,True,0,Color: Beats WhiteStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+
R1PTVZ5IJ2ZL6,B09JL41N9C,4.0 out of 5 stars Good for Apple ecosystem - not fully convinced at price point,decadeindc,4,"UPDATE 17 Feb 2024: Had to buy another pair after 13 months. The takeaway is: clean your earbuds thoroughly every 3-4 weeks with a earbud cleaning tool. There is a small screen on the little earbud sound exit point that’s visible when the ear tip is removed. That screen came entirely off on one earbud and the other earbud was partially blocked from impacted ear wax that had hardened so much that it fused to the screen (which is fragile and not attached to the housing with much glue). I cleaned the silicone tips regularly, but never cleaned those small openings and screens, much to my peril. (And yes, I clean my ears daily.) The earbuds still technically work ok, but without those screens in place, it’s only a matter of time before additional ear wax begins to change the sound and eventually corrode or block the drivers.Otherwise, my year-plus of experience with these earbuds was great. I used them for a minimum of an hour every day, and often much longer. They fit comfortably, produce great sound, hold good battery life, easily connect to all my Apple devices. I misjudged the battery life in my original review. Transparency mode is fine and noise canceling is good, although I’m not sure the trade off with battery life from “normal” mode is always worth it. The trade off of wired USB-C charging and no wireless charging is something I can live with. Don’t think any earbud is comfortable enough to wear all day on conference calls, but certainly around four hours is fine. I’ve experienced more than a few instances where the sound stops playing via my iPhone randomly and it looks like the Bluetooth connection has severed. I can’t just press on the left earbud to start playing again, I have to physically press play on my iPhone app and magically the earbuds start working again. Hard to tell what the problem is, but it happens once a week or so. Still think the price/value ratio is about as good as any other wireless earbud, especially in the Apple ecosystem, including AirPods.Original review … Pros: comfy for in-ear buds, especially for physical activity, works really nicely with Apple’s ecosystem including spatial audio, noise cancellation is very good as is transparency mode, sound quality is decent, can use one bud at a time if desired, USB-C charging. Cons: no multipoint connectivity, no wireless charging, water resistance rating lower than many other earbuds, battery life is barely adequate (both buds and charging case), outgoing audio voice quality is also just adequate.These are good earbuds, no question. But there are some maddening features skipped here that appear on much less expensive Bluetooth products. I still don’t understand why Apple’s Bluetooth audio products don’t include multipoint connectivity, even within their own ecosystem. My ancient Plantronics ear piece and my Bose headphones have had multipoint for years, and lack of it is really annoying when using the Beats for work purposes. Lack of wireless charging is less a concern for me, but is annoying at this price point if you’ve invested in the technology. The outgoing voice quality is probably fine for the form factor of the Beats, but it does sound like a telephone call when using Teams or Zoom rather than high quality audio. Biggest bug for me is these won’t make it through a full eight hour day of calls without a recharge, and the case only holds enough charge for 35 hours of use. I have a pair of Anker Life Dot 2s that are 5.5x less expensive with a 100 hour case that isn’t really any bigger. I realize many other buds won’t hit that eight hour mark either, so maybe it’s a complaint about the form factor.The sound quality is fine considering the Bluetooth codec used by Apple (either source or headphone) isn’t high def or even CD quality, despite what Apple might want you to think with the inclusion of spatial audio capability on the Beats. The drivers on the Beats are certainly acceptable for most users and given the mission and price point of the Beats, it’s about as good as anybody should expect. There’s room for improvement, but not much more without moving up in price or a change in codec use by Apple.One thing I did expect was a better water resistance rating. IPX4 is a little weak considering iPhones are at IP67.What I do really like is the noise cancellation (and transparency mode done well) of the Beats. Really works well. The earbuds are very comfortable to wear and get a good seal. The ear wings hold the earbuds in the ear without turning uncomfortable. Love the Apple ecosystem integration - these connect very easily with simple adjustments to iPhone and MacBook Pro alike.If you like the idea of AirPods Pro that fit better and stay in your ear more securely, you’ll probably like these. Again, for the price, these seem to hit most marks for what they are, which is a sort of Jack-of-all-trades Bluetooth earbud. Be sure to shop around if you value one specific element over another, like audio quality or battery life.","Reviewed in the United States January 8, 2023",AH553ARDDAOXIY2C5AOXI34LGJQA,True,53,Color: Sage GrayStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+
RE6HW0SD8290E,B09JL41N9C,4.0 out of 5 stars Patience required,Colleen,4,"I needed a new noise cancelling headphone to replace my old Bose earbuds. I wanted something wireless so I wouldn’t run into the problem I experience with my Bose earbuds - Apple changed the port again. So, I bought Beats since they had such good reviews. For the first couple of days I thought I was going to have to return them due to very muted sound through the right one. Plus, I have small ears and the darned thing hurt after just a few minutes. After reading a few articles, I did a hard reset but to no avail. It was finally on the 3rd reset and turning my iPhone off completely for a bit before repairing the Beats that I had success. As far as the fit, if you play around enough you’ll find an acceptable placement while still getting a good seal. But, patience and persistence paid off. These are good earbuds and I think I’m going to really like them.

R10AOMN7EKJ0R0,B09JL41N9C,4.0 out of 5 stars Slightly shy of perfection,VrunaS,4,"I have been using these for two days but tested the features extensible during that time so I thought I would share my thoughts if they help anyone.I wanted a pair of good earbuds for working out as well as extensive daily use- I listen to quite a bit of music as well as podcasts while I work. I have used Bose Soundsport wireless earbuds as my go to earbuds for the past 5 years and they finally are starting to reach the end of their life. Hence I decided that this prime day would be a good day to treat my ears to something nice.Overall I love these beats fit pro. They are super comfortable as other reviewers have pointed out to the point that if I wasn’t listening to anything on the earbuds I would possibly forget they were in my ears. Even though I loved them I wasn’t convinced they were worth the price until later today when I tried earbuds that were half the price and I hated them.As far as the features go here is what I feel-PROS:1. Super comfortable!! They might as well be the most comfortable earbuds I have ever used. What is surprising is the all the tips fit my ears well and feel comfortable. Even the largest tips that came with the earbud are super comfortable and don’t feel like they are stretching my ear canal- which is something I have never experienced before.2. Super secure in the ears- the wingtips hold them snug in the ear. They don’t budge even with the most intense activity. The earbuds are super low profile against the ears and not bulky or heavy at all. This enhances their comfort even more.3. Great music quality- I tested sounds from different genres and the songs that are suppose to be bass heavy (Get Lucky by Daft Punk for eg) do have a very nice skull shaking bass but in a very good way and without sacrificing the highs and mediums. Just as a point of reference (and because great quality can be a very subjective description)- the audio quality is very comparable to the one with the Bose Soundsport wireless earphones- the bass is just a hair better though.4. Earbuds appear in “Find My”- I love that I can potentially track where my earbuds are if I every lost them as long as they have a charge. They can also play a sound using the “find my” app to help you locate them. As a person who is constantly forgetting where I put things once I am home, this is going to serve me really well!5. Love having Siri compatible with the buds- Siri reading out my messages to me the past two days has been pretty fun and useful- Siri does interrupt your audio content jot announce messages (which my Bose never did) but this also means I won’t miss urgent texts while I am at work and not staring at my phone.CONS:1. ANC: it’s not absolute or the best out there although not a very critical point for me. I jump scare easily and so having something that completely cancels all background noise is not something I desire. I mean honestly for me the ANC is good enough- it completely gets rids of all low hums and mechanical noises— I was sitting next to my loud AC and with the ANC on it was whisper quiet. But I could still hear my husband speaking when he was near me and I could still hear the songs they were playing the gym if my own music was on a lower volume. So it doesn’t completely drown out all noise if that’s what you need. Again while the ANC for these is adequate for me- the only reason I put it as a con is because at this price point and considering ANC seems to be one of their major selling points I would have thought it would be better.2. Spatial Audio- this feature just seems like a waste for me. Although it’s personal preference I guess. With this feature it seems like the sound is coming from a specific point a few inches from my face- as if I were attending a live concert and inches away from the performer/band- and if I turn my head it does seem to track pretty well in that sense. However when I listen to music I would like it to be a completely immersive experience as if the sound is coming from inside my head not a fixed point out of my body. So for me I think it’s a pretty useless setting- at least for me.3. The case seems to be open easily in a bag or purse. The magnets holding the case closed are weaker than expected. Although I am not worried about the earphones automatically falling out of the case even if the case opens. The attachment of the earbuds to the case is very strong.","Reviewed in the United States July 15, 2023",AGEAS25333CRQMSXOQ6ZP2UJXGTQ,True,168,Color: Stone PurpleStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+
R38UJJJXRBSZ9H,B09JL41N9C,"4.0 out of 5 stars Good sound, secure fit",Sherry Young,4,"I bought these buds to replace my (1st gen) Powerbeats Pros. What I was looking for in an upgrade was better sound, better fit, and sound cancellation. The Beats Fit Pros largely delivered.I had the Powerbeats for almost 4 years, and they were fine. The sound was okay. The fit was secure, and comfortable on their own but not when wearing glasses. They were a little hard to put on, and they had a tendency for one of the buds to fail to charge that drove me crazy. So - the price reduction on the Beats Fit Pros convinced me that it was time to try something else.The Beats Fit Pros are easy to put in my ears, and plenty secure for everything I do. I have no trouble with either my long hair nor my glasses. They snap into the charging case and seem to solve the failure to charge problem.Sound and software featuresThey paired with my Apple devices flawlessly. The ear fit test was easy and helpful. Right out of the box, the sound was much like the Powerbeats. But running the quick ear scan for the adaptive eq and enabling spatial audio, set to fixed, made a huge difference. Highs sparkle, mids are clear and well separated, and it really gives a sense of soundstage that is hard to describe. Definitely keeping these.Sound CancellationI really don't have anything to compare the degree of sound cancellation to. The Powerbeats didn't have any, and my last attempt was with the original implementation by Bose, which really did not work for me. I heard a distinct buzz or hiss that degraded sound quality and I felt a headache-inducing pressure, so I stopped buying the tech. Since that was literally decades ago, I decided to try out the new tech. So, the caveats to this section are that I cannot compare them to the AirPods Pro 2 (supposedly better than the Beats) or the AirPods Pro 1 (supposedly not as good). Also, I live in a cabin in the woods and don't have a lot of noise to cancel. My overall impression was that the effect of the noise cancellation was - subtle. I ran two tests. First, I used the buds with some kind of power tool being used on a construction site about 100 yards away. It was loud enough to be annoying with the buds out. Just putting them in my ears accomplished some passive isolation. As you would expect, turning on ANC made the volume lower, and Transparency made the volume louder. With no music playing, I could hear the noise in all three modes. Playing music, the noise completely disappeared. The second test was in my living room with the tv on. The results were the same. I am satisfied with the sound cancellation on these buds. They don't hiss or buzz, they don't produce a sensation of pressure, and they remain comfortable after a few hours of use. I think whether the sound cancellation is good enough for you will depend on what sound you are trying to cancel and what other products you have tried.The one glaring flaw that prevented my giving them 5 stars is the way volume control works. First, the physical buttons can be used for EITHER volume control or changing noise cancellation modes. Whichever one is not chosen can be controlled by the phone or by Siri. I think the whole purpose of these bud is for activities where you don't want to be carrying/looking at your phone. Siri works (sometimes) but there is an annoying lag. Also, using Siri to move volume up and down is slow, hard to predict the amount of change, and requires spoken commands, often repeated ones. Not ideal in many situations. Also, if you set the button to control volume, they are ""fiddley"". There is a lag before adjustment begins, and it is then hard to stop it where you want it. Seriously, the one control I most use when listening to music is volume control. It needs to be done right. The Beats Fit Pro implementation is a big step down from the physical controls on the Powerbeats.Overall, I like these buds and am going to keep them. Should you buy them? Speculation is that the second generation is coming late 2023 or early 2024. Speculation is that they will get the superior sound cancellation currently available on the AirPods Pro 2. Will they get the upgraded ""Find My"" capability? Will they finally fix the volume control issue? No one knows. So, as always with tech, the decision to buy or wait depends on what you have now, how important potential improvements are to you, and how confident you are with feature and timing predictions.","Reviewed in the United States August 4, 2023",AHOLKA6LYBP76IOHUUWJZRBNZRQA,True,28,Color: Tidal BlueStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+
R3O9HACBPLU4S1,B09JL41N9C,4.0 out of 5 stars Not without its flaws,J. Kerekes,4,"The ""spatial audio"" gimmick feature cannot be turned completely off and is awful. One has to keep their head in one rigid orientation to be able to hear the music at normal volume; if you turn your head to the right, the left audio channel gets quieter. Very distracting and stupid feature. You can turn it ""off"" but it still activates on some audio sources (like youtube videos) where it just becomes an annoyance.That aside, the fit is good, the batteries lasts a good while, and the case and earphones have survived two separate 2ft drops onto hard surfaces. The sound is good but a lil bass heavy. Phone calls are fine but the person you're talking to will hear a lot of environmental noise, like traffic and wind.Overall, these are a great choice if you have $180-200 burning a hole in your pocket; certainly better than the $30 wireless earbuds I've had in the past - but not in proportion to the price difference. However, if you'd be watching or listening to a lot of youtube videos with these, you should probably get something else.","Reviewed in the United States June 5, 2024",AGCY7CTKNVITSE4O5PQO6CGWACXQ,True,1,Color: Volt YellowStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+

So here is my honest review after an afternoon of using them...As a preface: I am a longtime owner of Powerbeats Pro (the ones that fit around your ear). While I loved the battery life, the design of the charging case leads to a ton of charging issues and thus ability to use them. The headphones get loose when you're not using them if you don't precisely place them right, so when you go to use them they may not have a charge. I never liked the loop around your ears headphones either as it would give the back of my ear a rash/irritate my skin for some reason (may just be me, so keep that in mind).1. I've seen a lot of people saying the wing tip that helps secure the bud in your ears irritates theirs. This was a major concern for me when I first opened them. I spent a couple of hours wearing them, and even while working out, I felt no discomfort. Based on some other reviews, I'd say the shape/what your ear looks like matters. Mine feel fine though, so no complaints there. I work out a ton, so I'll be curious to see how they hold up.2. I noticed a ton of ANC debates in reviews for these, but there are debates regarding the ANC capabilities of other headphones (ex. Bose Quiet Comforts, which Bose is deemed the king of ANC). It is all relative, in my opinion. I used to have a pair of Airpod pros, and in my opinion, the ANC is just as good. I think it depends on what you can reference, but I have 0 complaints in the ANC on the Beats Fit Pro.3. An area I do agree with others on is the case... This thing is TINY. Way more than I thought, which is nice given you can really take them anywhere. The problem is the material, like others point out. It feels like plastic and is so slippery it feels like you could easily let it slip out of your hands. So be careful there I'd say.4. As Beats, ahem Apple, transition from USB to USB-C, a major let down is the fact you HAVE to be able to charge the Beats Fit Pro with a USB-C charger block, a Macbook, etc. So if you are thinking about getting these, buy one in advance or when you purchase them. They case charges super fast though, which is nice.5. I really like the look of these ear buds when compared to others. I never liked the look of Airpods, and the Bose Quiet comforts have always looked a little weird. Low profile and just overall look nice.Overall review: I'm pretty satisfied with the Beats Fit Pro. The fact I got them on sale from $200 to $150 is an absolute bonus as well. The ANC is good (does what I need/want), 6 hours of charge, with 15 minute fast charging if you for some reason need it, and overall look makes me pretty happy. I'll be curious to see how I feel overtime of course, but as of right now, I'd recommend them if you're looking for some ear buds. I'd say keep in mind how the winged tip has irritated other's ears as that may depend on your overall shape of your ear.Overall grade: B+ (Only because of the case material, how easy it is to drop it, and the mandatory USB-C charging)Edit: Be careful buying from Amazon. Your headphones can clearly not be new despite saying you are buying them new. My warranty, when I bought them in the beginning of May, only runs till the end of October 2023. If you buy any Apple product, I believe, you get a full year limited warranty. They look new, but you don't get them in the typical plastic wrap Apple headphones come in. What you get for buying them at a good price though, so assuming I have no issues, this should be okay. Still satisfied none the less!","Reviewed in the United States May 5, 2023",AFRATEP246MOENSBSXOOA3LA5GXA,True,62,Color: Sage GrayStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+
ROURQZ9MDIWGH,B09JL41N9C,"5.0 out of 5 stars If you use Apple products and you're on the fence, buy these",Donald Yeske,5,"I bought these to replace my Bose noise-cancelling earbuds when they finally died. I considered buying Apple branded wireless earbuds, but the Beats earbuds are just as tightly integrated as the Apple earbuds, and they offer superior features for a lower cost. They walk you through selecting the right size for the cups for your ears and they have a built-in audio check to ensure you're getting a good seal. I wear these on the treadmill; they are comfortable, the battery life is exactly as advertised, and the sound quality is amazing. I work out at a Planet Fatness, and they do a great job of blocking out noises and distractions around me, allowing me to focus on my run. They work pretty well for phone calls and they do have a feature where you can long-press and have it do several different things (by default, it will enable transparency--and it seems like you're not wearing earbuds at all). Honestly, the best earbuds I've ever owned, and while I can't speak to how well they might work in an Android ecosystem, they are tremendous with Apple products.","Reviewed in the United States May 25, 2024",AESYAEXHBQSE4B6DLWY5MABBS7MQ,True,4,Color: Tidal BlueStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+

I thought I'd like these and wouldn't switch back to AirPods however I was incorrect. The speakers sound is starting to go in and out especially if I am on the phone or a conference call. These were great to connect to a work laptop but now, people can barely hear me speaking. Originally these were bought for the noise cancelling quality and color option but I'm not sure I got my moneys worth for one year of use. Having kids and dogs around was the main reason I bought them but again they started to deteriorate around the 1 year mark. The noise cancelling quality isn't up to par with the AirPod Pros since I can still hear the dogs barking.If you only want headphones to last one year then these are the headphones for you. I'd recommend them then. But long term and time usage isn't on there side.","Reviewed in the United States May 9, 2024",AGHK4IZ5ZR5GCA2AUD5GDCZZFPRQ,True,1,Color: MoonStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+

R95F9KJ192OD0,B09JL41N9C,5.0 out of 5 stars Beats Fit Pro sound and fit much better than the AirPod Pros!,DT,5,"Got these on sale w/AppleCare+ and I've got to say they are so much better than my 3yo AirPod Pros. The bass from the Beats sounds amazing and the fit with the wingtip is excellent. I never could get my AirPod Pros to fit properly even with 3rd party ear-tips and they were constantly falling out of my ears!These Beats have the H1 chip, Active Noise Cancelling, Spacial Audio and are 'Find My' compatible. I've paired them with my iPhone 14 Pro Max, iPad Pro and Mac Studio with no issues.The only negatives would be that the included USB-C cable is very short but shouldn't really matter since most people have numerous longer cables. The bigger issues is with the case. It's extremely light weight and very slick so it could possibly be easy to drop. I just ordered a cheap silicon case for it which I really shouldn't have had to do if they designed it better in the first place. And it doesn't support wireless charging like the newer AirPod Pro cases if that's important to you. Even with those slight negatives I would still highly recommend these over the AirPod Pros.","Reviewed in the United States May 11, 2024",AHB2P6TOYCKYGRCECL6IEOB6GN6Q,True,3,Color: Sage GrayStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+
R35LEDCWE9RBVL,B09JL41N9C,3.0 out of 5 stars Very disappointing for what Beats is supposed to be,Cecil Aragon,3,"I am very disappointed in these earbuds. The first problem is that the ANC is not as good as you would think. The second problem is the lack of good bass. I mean these are Beats. They cost sooo much compared to earbuds from lesser known brands, and so you would think that they would be the best quality, but they aren't.I am not a name brand person at all. However, the ONLY reason I bought these is because I was looking for earbuds that would not fall out of my ear like my others do. These are the ONLY ones that I could find that have a hook to keep them in my ear. So I broke down and bought them. Well, they do stay in my ear which is the one positive.Now on to the disappointing negatives.1) ANC - the active noise cancellation is there, but it isn't as strong as my other earbuds that were less than half the price of these Beats. I am using them at the gym, and they just don't cancel out as much noise as my others and I am super disappointed in that. I can still hear too much ambient noise.2) Bass - the bass on these is sorely lacking. Again, my less expensive earbuds have way better bass than these - the known name brand expensive earbuds. I literally stood there in my kitchen and traded the Beats back and forth in my ears with my less expensive ones and no matter how much I tried to have the Beats come out with greater bass, they just don't.So in the end, for me, these are mediocre quality earbuds for way too much. I don't know if we're allowed to mention other brands on here so I won't but I will say that the overall sound quality and the ANC on my cheaper earbuds is way better. Again, the one positive is that these don't fall out of my ears. All that for so much more money.","Reviewed in the United States June 10, 2024",AFU6RZBAB6LPD5ZRQP3VMCS6NSKA,True,4,Color: Tidal BlueStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+

They're easily configurable, comfortable, and they sound great. They don't fall out of my ears like my old 1st generation AirPods did while running at the gym. However, my *only* complaints are that I wish they interfaced with my Apple products a bit better, and the case is disappointingly ""cheap"" feeling. The hinge mechanism feels very flimsy, and the plastic case feels nearly toy-like to me, especially when compared to the old first generation AirPods case that I replaced with the Beats.Overall, a great set of earbuds that just left me wanting a bit more.

R1BP17EAFK1IR6,B09JL41N9C,"4.0 out of 5 stars I LIKE THEM, but It's because it's what I was looking for",Klaus Haraldsson,4,"A 4 star rating is very fair for these, I wish I could give them a 4.5 though. While searching for new earbuds, I had three things that I was looking for. If you aren't looking for what I was, which it can be 50/50, then you may be better off going with another option (Like Bose).Grip, Comfortability, and Ease of Use.In terms of Grip, I wanted a pair of earbuds that would stay on my ear. If I were to go for a run, work out, or play basketball I wanted earbuds that would rarely or never fall out. I had recently had a pair of the AirPods Pro, and they DID NOT workout for me, as they would fall out of my ear VERY EASILY. With the Beats Fit Pro, the little wing tip that goes on the inner part of your ear, aside from the actual earbud that goes inside of your ear, actually provides GREAT grip, and I've been able to do my workouts without these falling off. I also thing that since these earbuds DO NOT STICK OUT OF YOUR EAR as much as a BOSE or AirPods Pro do, that it adds more grip to stay on your ear.In terms of comfortability, this should be fairly straight forward. I've had cheap earbuds were after an hour or so of wearing them, your ear starts to get very sore. So much so, that it even hurt to take them off. So far, the Beat Fit Pro earbuds have been pretty good so far. I played around with the different size earbuds that they provide, and have found the size for me. I did noticed that, you have to play around with how they fit in your ear in order to get that ""perfect fit"" we are all looking for. When I first put them on, I had to rotation the earbud and play around with where the wing tip would go, before I found the spot that works for me. I just recently went on a 4 hour flight, and throughout the whole trip, my ear did not get sore.Regarding the Ease of Use, it was very simple to connect the Beats, and it is also very simple to change the settings from Noise Canceling, to Transparency, to turning both of those off if you wish. You do not need to download an app or anything, which is amazing for me as I hate the earbuds where you need to download an app and create an account, etc. I give this a 5/5.Now, there are things that are not the best when it comes to the Beats Fit Pro, that I think other earbuds will work better.Sound, and Noise Cancelation.I would give the sound a 3.5/5. It is not the loudest, doesn't have the best bass, and it's not the most profound. What I mean by profound, is those headphones in which you can hear every sound that goes into a certain beat. This is where I think, that if an amazing sound is all you care about, then going with a Bose might be better for you. At it's loudest volume, the Beats Fit Pro are really not that loud. I've had headphones were you can't stay on the loudest volume because it's simply just to loud. It's kind of the opposite with the Beats. The loudest they go, is about how I like them when I listen to music.Now, the Noise Cancelation on the Beats Fit Pro DOES WORK. I tried them in my house, and had some of my friends talk to me, and I really could not hear a word they were saying. I like that in the Beats Fit Pro, it is VERY EASY to turn the Noise Canceling feature off. HOWEVER, when in a relatively medium sounding environment, the Beats Fit Pro, won't fully block out all the sound. Even worse, if you are in a large sounding environment, you will 100% be able to hear everything going on. This most likely has to do with the lack of sound that I was explaining on the previous paragraph. I feel that if the sound was louder and more profound on the Beats, the Noise Cancelation would be much better.If you happen to read my long description, I hope this help!","Reviewed in the United States October 24, 2022",AHSA34L25CYRE4DF2VS5NFDW53SQ,True,436,Color: Beats BlackStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+

R1YCY2ISTC6WYR,B09JL41N9C,"4.0 out of 5 stars Missing Features, but Solid Overall",Josh Rodine,4,"Generally speaking, I like these a lot. I use my earbuds almost exclusively for working out, so fit and comfort are very high on my list. I tend to have a hard time keeping earbuds in my ears, but the ""wings"" on these do a magnificent job of holding the earbuds in place. I'm not much of an audiophile, but I think the sound quality is pretty good. Nice bass, and the treble isn't to tinny.Now for my complaints (and there are a few). My most recent buds were Sennheiser Momentum 3. They had a ton of features that the Beats Fit Pro lack. There's no customizable EQ. You can't control both volume and ANC/Transparency with the buttons on the buds (you can do both, but you have to choose whether the buds will control volume or the ANC/Transparency features--whichever you don't select has to be controlled through the device on which you're listening. This is really annoying for someone who is working out and not holding a phone. Ideally, I'd be able to control all of these features (i.e., playback start/stop/ff/rew, volume, and ANC) through the buttons on the buds (which was the case with the Sennheisers). That said, I really do appreciate that these have buttons rather than touch sensors (the later of which are far too easily activated by something simple like readjusting the position of the bud in the ear).","Reviewed in the United States March 26, 2024",AEQPR5N42OOFL3SDJNXZPSKBLQDA,True,0,Color: Beats BlackStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+

The earbuds themselves are very high quality, sound great, feel great, and play nice with everything in the Apple ecosystem because of the H1 chip. Which is a plus for me, as I’m an Apple user on most things.I feel like Apple is likely going to release an updated version of these in the near future, as it’s been like 2+ years now.

RAUKXC8YQKMSG,B09JL41N9C,3.0 out of 5 stars Very underwhelming,William R.,3,"First off, let me say, these are ok. I didn't have any issues or problems with them at all. The worked, paired easily, sounded good and stayed put pretty decent for my workout.Why the mid line review then?Well, I was just underwhelmed by the buds. For pushing almost $200, I expect something really high end, and something with some more adaptability, and these aren't that.First of all, the sound was good, but it didn't blow me away, and in that price point, I expected more. Second, the fit was ok, borderline not so good. I bought these for the gym. Now I am a big guy, and have big ears, probably bigger than most, but the ""wings"" on these buds were worthless for me, they were so small in my ear they provided absolutely no function what so ever. Again, for this price point, I would have thought these might come with some additional ""wings"" to adapt to each ear, that isn't the case. Last, I wasn't crazy about the ear tips, the selection wasn't great and they didn't provide a better seal or fit, in fact I used a pair of tips from another much cheaper brand that worked way better than what they provided with these.So in conclusion, the price point and what I got for the money wasn't enough for me to keep them. In fact, I bought another brand on here (off brand) and they have better sound, an app with an equalizer for custom sound, super stable and a fraction of the price so I kept those and returned the beats.

Let me tell ya, the cheap ones that advertise that function I have to believe are lying. In reality, it doesn't appear that cheaper buds have any such noise cancelling technology. You can generally determine this if there seems to be no method to actually turn off the alleged noise cancelling, i.e., you can't turn off what's not there in the first place. And there would certainly be a way to turn off noise cancelling if it existed because doing so would save so much power and extend the life of your buds by several hours. So remember folks, if you're buying some 40 dollar buds that supposedly have noise cancelling tech: think again. Additionally, some of the earbuds I've bought previously also had over-the-ear hooks, because the ones without that device invariably fell out of my ear. The problem with my ears is that even with the ear hooks/loops, they could come out of my ears and just dangle there. Really annoying. None of my prior ones were expensive, but I finally decided to pony up and buy something a little expensive that I'd hoped I would like and be more effective: the Beats Fit Pro. They don't use a hook over the ear, they have a smaller soft loop that hooks INSIDE your ear. Totally different concept, but for me it works! I have no idea how well it'll work for others, but for me it's a godsend. They are stable and have no tendency to fall out. I put sound muffs over them when I'm cutting the grass on an extremely loud mower so I can listen to tunes when cutting and they haven't fallen out yet. And importantly, there is real and functional noise cancelling technology in these things. It can be controlled either by a button on one of the buds or by your smartphone, and it actually works. But be aware, it's not super great! It really does work: honestly there is real noise cancelling happening. But I've yet to use a noise cancelling technology that was super-effective, and this is no different. But at least it's real and there and does do something. And finally, there's the sound: they sound very good, and offer a good bit more bass response than the other earbuds I've used. You're never going to find earbuds that sound as good as proper set of headphones, but these sound really good. I'd buy these again--right now--as well as recommend them. Great sound, great fit and haven't fallen out, noise cancelling that actually works. All pluses. All in all, they're pretty nice, at least so far. I'm not disappointed, but if I should change my mind, I'll revise this review. Lastly, I was hesitant to buy these because I wasn't sure of the in-ear hook, but it actually works for me. For others with differently shaped ears, who knows!","Reviewed in the United States August 16, 2023",AFE5B2OAXWLQ5QDQVYUGAW3TSXJQ,True,11,Color: Beats BlackStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+

That's about it.I switched from Apple to Android recently, and I'm loving it. Especially because I could get these buds and essentially ""keep my airpods"" I thought since they're internally the same, but this wasn't the case.I'm on my second pair of these because the first ones didn't connect properly, stay connected, then they wouldn't update. So I got another pair that didn't have these problems except for the connectivity. It's still spotty, ANC is there but definitely not even as good as the 2nd Gen AirPod Pro's I replaced. I will say I appreciate the controls on these much more than the stalks on the AirPods, if you didn't grip those just right they wouldn't work anyway.Overall they're not bad, but they're overpriced even at a discounted sale of ~$170 considering that AirPods do still outperform these in so many little ways. Quite honestly I wouldn't be surprised if Apple does these things on purpose to move people back towards their own brand. Who knows. Either way, solid earbuds, but there's definitely better out there.","Reviewed in the United States July 5, 2024",AGY7AMBZI4V6F6HJP53FH5B5QW5Q,True,0,Color: Beats BlackStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+

RFVMZ1TEOIUYS,B09JL41N9C,4.0 out of 5 stars Kim K Beats,KK,4,"The media could not be loaded. Ugh I never write reviews but going to just this once for the hell of it! Gave this a 4 out of 5 stars but in my words here’s why…Purchased these in replace of the newest AirPod Pros… AirPods were constantly falling out my ears, hurting my little tiny ears, a(n)extremely uncomfortable and unpleasant time. 0 out of 10 do not recommend! Seriously. I think this is good decent product. You can say I’m pretty satisfied with my purchase. First off, love the color. Really adore that part. Purposely purchased the color because not only is it giving baddie.. it blends with my skin tone, damn near perfectly. So when I’m at work, or even if my hair is up, or just even out and about, people can’t even tell I have earbuds in. Very discreet and convenient for that reason. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been asked if they are hearing aids at work lol. They also do not fall out whatsoever. Like seriously. These babies ain’t going no where. Haven’t tried working out in them yet but I think it’ll be fine even with sweating. Really great sound quality, features (ex. noise cancellation *chefs kiss*), and super comfortable. Love that you can adjust to whatever shape or size your ear is! Along with the buds being very flexible. Even hours after wearing they may start to get a little uncomfortable and you can fix and adjust them so you don’t have any issues. Audio is excellent and great phone call/FaceTime quality as well. No complaints with sound. When i’m on the phone people be hearing TOO much lol. The ONLY negative(s) I have to say are that honestly probably wouldn’t purchase them again not for sound or feature reasons but the overall quality for the price! Definitely way over priced but I get it because it is a Kim Kardashian promoted product.. but atleast make the material more attractive and sturdy in regards tothe quality. Case that the beats are stored in is very light weight .. like too light. It really feels and looks cheaply made. Like they should be $45 at THE Walmart Supercenter .. Love the flexibility of the buds themselves but dislike the overall quality of the case the earbuds are stored in. The case also charges the buds as well and lasts throughout my 12 hour shift with battery to listen and not having to charge them at any point during my shift. I’ve really only seen it had them die a couple of times on me and that’s really my fault for forgetting to charge them lol. Really wished they could’ve used a more sustainable and STURDY material. Otherwise, everything else checks out and I will say that these are wayyy better than AirPods (at least for me and my small ears) and for reference I have had each version of the AirPods. Very comfortable, can tune people and surroundings out so easily. Love that part. ANYWAYS thanks for reading! That’s the Tea✨✨ hope you decide topurchase!! You may or may not regret it lol.

R1YI8HOGIQ0V62,B09JL41N9C,"4.0 out of 5 stars Amazing, But with a Few Cons",Joanna Watson,4,"The Beats Fit Pro are amazing! I've tried earbuds that were twice the price as the Beats and felt like I was wasting my money in comparison. The Beats give you a better value for the money and are comfortable. After a few minutes, I almost forget that I'm wearing them. The battery life is very good. No complaints from anybody when I make phone calls with them. The sound quality is top notch, even with an Android. It's easy to switch between ANC (active noise canceling) and transparency with a press of the button on the earbuds.It's important to note though that in order to get the best sound quality, you will want to download the Beats app to your phone. It's available for both, Android and iPhone. In the app, scroll down and select ""Ear fit test."" It will play soft music briefly then determine if they are sealed properly. You can use this to reposition the earbuds in your ears for the best sound. Experiment with the different size tips that come with the Beats. Once you find the ones that are right for you, getting them in your ears properly will be a breeze. This may sound like a hassle, but it's not that bad. It only takes a minute and will be well worth it. If you don't go through this process, they will sound horrible.Aside from that, I do see a couple of cons. While the sound is amazing, the bass isn't quite as punchy as I had expected. Sometimes while listening to hip hop, I wish I could crank it up more. On the other hand, the bass is perfect for everything else. There is an equalizer in the app, but it's buried. I only found it a couple times and even then, the settings were limited. So I ended up using the preset to what sounded the most natural and left it at that. The volume doesn't go as high as I had expected either. But, I find that it's been about perfect, even if I do have to max out the volume on the phone at times. The case feels nice in the hand and hold the Beats securely. The hinge on the lid feels a little flimsy, so I'm always somewhat gentle with it. I definitely wouldn't recommend sticking the case in your back pocket where you'll sit on it.It would be nice if the app had more features and the case had a better hinge on the lid but overall, I appreciate the simple, straight-forward design. The Beats have never jiggled loose or fallen out of my ears during workouts. No earbuds are 100% perfect, but these come pretty close. My only regret is that I didn't order them sooner. For a minute there, I almost forgot about Dre!","Reviewed in the United States March 11, 2023",AH5AISJ345LZH5FKSWEHTAD7XJ7Q,True,83,Color: Stone PurpleStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+

(so if you have a noisy coworker like me who sits on one side of you, and only one earbud is charged... you get it!) color is also true to advertising! beautiful lilac purple shade. and for range- just today I was doing laundry and didn't realize I had left my phone in my locked apartment one floor up and two large, closed rooms over until i was in the middle of moving a load to the dryer! seriously, it is POWERFUL.cons - they can hurt your ears if you leave them in for hours at a time, where the hooks rest. but for the quality...honestly, after an hour or two straight, just take a break! for noise cancellation, on runs it can make you feel like you're hitting altitude in an airplane, but DO NOT use noise cancellation on runs anyway! you need to hear cars and other potential hazards around you! and i haven't had issues with it on a treadmill, so this really isn't necessarily a con. :) they don't support wireless charging! and it only comes with a usbc (or whatever it's called) charger, neither end is a USB and it does not include a wall plug! however those you can buy for dirt cheap at walmart or meijer, so fret not. i usually use the usc slot on my work computer to charge mine. like others have said, case does feel a little flimsy so i might get a hard shell for it just in case.TLDR: if you're a runner, or have a noisy coworker, or on the go and want great sound quality and battery life, GET THEM!

Next pair will likely be white or another light color. Buds themselves have been trouble free. Sound quality is good, almost as good as Airpods Pro generally.

RT2QNRC1DI8RH,B09JL41N9C,"5.0 out of 5 stars If you have hearing loss, these buds are for you",James Coplan,5,"I have a moderate to severe hearing loss in the higher frequencies. Partly due to age, and partly due to noise trauma (exposure to firearms without ear protection; loud motorcycle). Up until recently I was wearing my prescription hearing aids (no bluetooth), along with over-the-ear headphones to listen to music and media while exercising. However, neither the hearing aids nor the headphones are sweat-proof, and they have both suffered the consequences. I was hesitant to try ear buds because of my hearing loss - without my hearing aids the world sounds like I have wads of cotton stuffed in my ear canals. Those of you with the same issue will understand.Unlike the younger set, who want lots of bass, I need to have lots of treble to offset my HL. So one of my big criteria for earbuds was a decent EQ (equalizing) feature.On my iphone, the Beats app offers to import a photograph of my audiogram (under ""Audio Accessiblity Settings > Custom Audio Setup""). Then the app reads the photo and generates a copy for itself, from which it calculates how much to compensate for my hearing loss. In effect, the earbuds take on the role of hearing aids when listening to music or media. The attached photo shows my actual audiogram, and the ""derived"" version created by the app after importing the photo. (How the app does that without a scanner I have no idea - but it's pretty slick). Not shown is an intermediary screen, which enables the user to add or edit missing or misread data.On my iPad, the Beats app presents a series of paired listening samples and asks the user to choose which one sounds better each time. Not sure if the ipad can also import my audiogram, but the result of the paired listening test seems good to me.I cannot attest to other brands, because these are the only ones I own, but if you have hearing loss, these buds are for you.PS: I also like the little flexible ""wing"" on each earbud, that secures the earbud in place in the ear canal, rather than relying entirely on friction between the earbud tip and the walls of the ear canal.","Reviewed in the United States October 19, 2023",AHKRU5RBEQXNXC7J5YANCBMJFNHQ,True,29,Color: Beats BlackStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+
R1MWZQSJ5LH66J,B09JL41N9C,4.0 out of 5 stars It's aight,Alexis Valenzuela,4,"I kept watch when the price would go down to purchase these, and I'm glad I did because they are nowhere near worth the original price. The main reason why I kept this product and didn't return them was because of their color and how they are easier to hide with my hair down than Apple AirPods. Aesthetically pleasing look overcame all the cons for me. So Kimberly, great job on selecting nude colors for beats to produce.Noise cancellation was not what I was expecting either. 6/10. I have to push them into my ears to get mediocre sound quality. BUT, once I do have them placed in my ear to where they won't fall off. I was watching a podcast with both earpieces in and got spooked by the spatial audio feature. I felt like I was in a movie theatre and everyone could hear what I was listening to. After owning them for 6 months, I was finally impressed with the quality.My biggest issue with these is when I pause my music, all I hear is a low hum of static. It's like some type of sound has to be playing for these to not make that annoying sound.Battery life lasts more than I expected. Longer than my previous Airpod Pros 1st gen did.I enjoy the wing tip feature because I primarily use these to work out and I haven't had trouble with them staying on while I deadlift. With that being said, if I don't use the wingtip, they do fall out as my airpods would.","Reviewed in the United States December 4, 2023",AETQL6ZWELWS5ZBPCMYVEZL5YVDQ,True,0,Color: DuneStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+

Be aware you may not get the full 12 month limited Apple/Beats warranty. During the pairing/set up process I noticed on the warranty info screen that my warranty was 2 months short of the full year from purchase date. Curious as to why, I contacted Apple Support. Their explanation was that the seller/reseller (Amazon) is responsible for resetting the warranty date. Not sure if this is 100% true or not, that was their reasoning for the shortened end date. I then contacted Amazon and through a long drawn out chat the resolution was they would replace my pair. They really had no explanation for me as to why this issue occurred but assured that the issue would be addressed. I received the replacement pair next day and during pairing/set up I checked the warranty on this pair and we have the same issue The warranty is short exactly 2 months from 1 year of the purchase date. I'm not pursuing the issue this time as I figure if there truly is going to be a warranty issue it will manifest itself sooner than later.

R157LGUAIEIW85,B09JL41N9C,4.0 out of 5 stars Good but only good.,RW414,4,"2023-08-07: I am going to upgrade this to a 4 star (which is really a 3.5). They're decent buds and, while the wing-thing should be user-replaceable, it's a bit of a belt-and-suspenders thing (unless you're hanging upside-down or have the world's oiliest ears you should be fine even when they fall off, which they probably will). They're ok. Not sure there's a reason to go with them over current-gen AirPods.So I'm going to assume here that you're looking at these and going ""Oh hey, they're as iOS-integrative as AirPods but they also have a little wing-thing that holds them in: neat!"" because that was my thought process too.Let's dispense with the positive first: The earbuds are good if maybe not great at their core functionality (playing sound), the H1 chip makes pairing these with iOS really easy and it integrates with iOS well. The buds look good and they're fairly comfortable (I think my ears are pretty normal), The sound quality and battery life and noise cancellation were all good, certainly good enough to recommend. No physical volume controls so bear that in mind.Most negative reviews seem to focus on how the case is trash and it very much is: the surface is made from a slippery plastic (feels different from the plastic of the earbuds) and has a single hinge that doesn't feel very secure (it relies on the case magnet to stay closed), the case doesn't show up on FindMy (the buds do which is a nice feature). The case feels in a word ""cheap"" which is a problem at this price. It's actually strange how much the case feels like it belongs to an entirely different product!My issue isn't with the case though, it's with what I talked about above as being the reason I bought it, the product-defining feature: the little wing-thing that holds it to the ear. If you use these regularly but have to remove them often the wing *will* start to tear at the ""stem"" near the connection between it and the bud. That needn't have been a problem (or at least not a problem serious enough to not recommend it) if the wings were user-replaceable but they aren't. This is user-unfriendly design: if you have a multi-component device the failure of a non-core component which doesn't compromise the functionality of the core component should be removable and replaceable by the end user to maximize the service life of the device. Additionally, from an accessibility perspective removable wing-things would make the device usable by people with a broader range of ear sizes (in much the same way as eartips are variably sized).A $200 set of earbuds with a product-defining feature (the wing) shouldn't have that feature made from a material that doesn't have the tensile strength to accomplish the purpose of the feature (hold the bud to the ear) while tolerating the stress implied by that function and that of removal/insertion to the ear. The wing itself rests on the case surface with slight tension when the buds are clicked into the case and I suspect this doesn't do anything to improve their lifespan either. All of that might even be excusable if the design were modular enough to allow user replacement of the stressed components but they haven't done that.To sum up: Good earbuds, terrible case, interesting and product-defining wings but with poor materials choices and bad modularity. I don't have a suggestion as to what you should get but it shouldn't be this.","Reviewed in the United States April 22, 2022",AGRQVXOCVOHQKBIVNZBSGXQKLKFA,True,40,Color: Beats BlackStyle: Fit ProSet: Without AppleCare+

I used the smallest ear tips and even that was a bit too big. I ended up using a pair of ear tips smaller than what came with but the ear hooks just don’t stay in place very well. I guess there’s no one size fits all on ear buds. The sound quality is so good so I decided to keep them. I learned to turn the ear hooks on my ears more to the left to keep them stay in place better.

RAI90QWJQJF03,B0CCBKGDJD,5.0 out of 5 stars Literally mind-blowing upgrading from AirPods Pro 2,Christian Waymire,5,"Beats**all coming from an airpods & airpods pro 2 user**Two notes about me:* I have a pretty average sized head & ears* I wear glassesThoughts:- Noise isolation is way better than people give credit for, works about as well as the active noise cancellation on my airpods pro 2.- I can FEEL the bass.- Can hear all kinds of details in music (like when I upgraded to airpods pro but slightly better than even those). The AirPods gen 2 did that for me, then the AirPods Pro 2 did it again, and now these are doing the same.- Electronic music sounds absolutely amazing. Better than any other headphones or speaker I’ve heard.- Classical sounds amazing—way better than AirPods Pro 2.- Folk sounds amazing, & it’s like someone’s playing a really high end guitar right next to me while also serenading me.- Piano also sounds especially amazing- Case is slightly padded, but leaves a lot to be desired there—they also barely fit (see pictures).- They feel durable, even at hinges (which shocked me).- They DO fingerprint easily, if that matters to you.- Box is very sleek & giftable.- Not having the automatic ear detection is really nice for when I lift one side up to hear someone or something.- They are more comfortable than AirPods Pro, even with memory foam ear tips on those. But they do get slightly annoying with glasses but there is a sweet spot where it’s not bad (if I angle the headband towards the back of my head instead of having it straight up and down). But it’s not so uncomfortable that I don’t want to use them. Merely a minor inconvenience.- I ever so slightly wish I could see the battery percentage on my phone while charging, but it’s not any real inconvenience.- The micro-USB charger is potentially going to be a slight inconvenience because they wear out—USB-C or a lightening cord would’ve been way better.- Pairing with an iPhone is extremely easy.- The included carabiner for the case is a nice afterthought, but it’s a super flimsy carabiner and the loop keeping it on the case is tiny and I wouldn’t trust it. If it were better sewn and had a bigger loop, that’d be fantastic. I CAN attach an aluminum locking carabiner, but it’s just barely big enough for that.- Charging seems pretty fast, and while I do wish it would show me the percentage while charging, I really appreciate seeing the percentage in the battery widget while connected because other non-apple Bluetooth headphones don’t have that and I’m left guessing how much is left on the tiny control center icon with those.In sum, I HIGHLY recommend these if you’re looking for good bluetooth headphones and don’t have $400+ to spend. I snagged them for $99.95, and I couldn’t be happier. They’re definitely a good value at $200, but they’re mind blowing at a part-time, minimum wage budget. Almost every feature has been either mind blowingly fantastic, but those that aren’t are barely worth commenting on.Are they perfect? No. Should one expect perfection at this price? Absolutely not.

R2IQV1A1SCQDVZ,B0CCBKGDJD,5.0 out of 5 stars These headphones deserve the hype!,Mariah Chapman,5,"At last I finally found the perfect wireless headphones!! I bought these back in November when they were on sale for Black Friday (only $80!) and wanted to give them a test period before I reviewed them. Here’s what I’ve experienced this far:Pros1. The sound quality is impeccable. Literally everything is so clear and crisp. Funny enough, to put it into perspective, I was watching a movie and did not notice faint background music until I put these headphones on.2. The battery life is great. For me, they last roughly 72 hours before I need to fully recharge them. With charging, it takes maybe 40 minutes to an hour to get back up to a full charge. Impressive3. They’re compact and foldable. You’d be surprised how many headsets don’t fold when you’re done using them but these are perfect if you need to travel.4. They can connect to anything! I connected them to the Bluetooth on my tv for the first time since I didn’t want to wake my roommate up at 2am and set up was easy and simple.5. Changing the volume or song is simple and easy.6. Not really a pro, just an opinion, but they are really cute and stylish.Cons:1. A lot of people were right about them hurting your ears after having them on for too long; maybe more than 4 hours of continuous wear. I wish the part that goes around your ears was a little bigger to minimize the discomfort, but nonetheless it’s not a huge deal.2. Don’t connect them to numerous things at once. For instance, I had these paired with my iPhone and laptop at the same time. When I turned on my laptop it disconnected from my iPhone automatically and vice versa. My suggestion, disconnect from the device you’re not using and only focus on one sole device at a time.3. I wish the charger came with a charging block instead of just a wire. If you don’t have an extra block make sure you get one.4. They are not 100% noise cancelling but it does block out a good amount of outside noise5. My only concern is that when you call someone or someone calls you there’s a weird echo in the background. Like every time you talk it sounds like you’re talking in a tunnel? Again not a big deal just something I’ve noticed.Overall, I’m really happy with this purchase and if you’re considering getting these just do it.

Whether I'm listening to my favorite music, podcasts, or audiobooks, the audio is crisp, clear, and full-bodied, allowing me to fully immerse myself in the listening experience.The wireless connectivity is another major selling point for these headphones. Thanks to the Apple W1 headphone chip and Class 1 Bluetooth technology, pairing the headphones with my devices is seamless and hassle-free. Plus, with up to 40 hours of listening time on a single charge, I never have to worry about running out of battery during long commutes or flights.However, it's important to note that the ear covers on the Beats Solo3 headphones may not fully cover the ears, which can cause discomfort for those with sensitive ears. As someone who prefers over-ear headphones for this reason, I did notice some discomfort after extended periods of use.Overall, despite this minor issue, the Beats Solo3 Wireless On-Ear Headphones are an excellent choice for anyone in search of stylish, high-quality headphones with impressive sound and wireless convenience.

R1SLLOFV53BSY,B0CCBKGDJD,5.0 out of 5 stars Love these.,Bart,5,"I got my first pair in 2016 for free from Apple when I bought a computer with my student discount. I used them every day until sometime in 2023 when the overhead band snapped. So I bought these to replace them.I have a very small head and stretched earlobes. Most over ear head phones are way too big and fall off if I look down. Or they sit in a way that makes my plugs dig into the pressure point behind the ear lobe. These head phones do neither. They fit snug without hurting my hears, these are on ear not over the ear. They do start to ache if I wear them for several hours with my glasses on though, like if I’m on a flight for a long time. But I think that happens with most headphones.They have great base and are great for noise cancelling. They fully charge in about on hour. Maybe less.Definitely recommend if you’ve got a small head and shuffle to find headphones that stay on. If you’re a giant man with a giant head, don’t get these. They’ll be too small.","Reviewed in the United States May 27, 2024",AFM3O6PY6AYDORNPO4BIMBHD4TYQ,True,0,Color: Rose GoldStyle: Solo3Set: Without AppleCare+

I'm sure there are products with better sound quality and noise canceling but for the low price and insane battery life they're definitely better than most other products ive seen.They're comfortable and easily adjusted, my only complaint is that they're fairly tight so it can hurt your ears after a few hours but that's bound to happen with any headphones.Overall great product, I've used them every day since I bought them and never once regretted my purchase.","Reviewed in the United States June 8, 2024",AF6CZPUOUWRIFXF4VB3VFLZGYCDA,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: Solo3Set: Without AppleCare+
R1NPJGY6ZELSU,B0CCBKGDJD,"4.0 out of 5 stars Perfect for running, ear pads a bit small",M,4,"I run outdoors frequently and was looking for a decent pair of headphones because my area is noisy and I was tired of constantly adjusting my airpods while running. I wanted something with serviceable audio quality that I also wouldn't mind putting through the constant wear and tear of sweaty runs. I was previously wearing a more expensive pair of headphones to run, and while I do prefer those for use at home or for noise-canceling, they were too heavy and hot for running and I was worried about damaging them. The beats solo3 are a better fit for this particular use case (for me).Pros:- the apple bluetooth chip is extremely useful, it makes it so much more convenient to switch between devices! Major QOL improvement over other headphones I own- lightweight and don't make my ears hot during exercise- stay put well even with a lot of movement (I've even worn these while hanging upside down at the gym and they didn't fall off)- blocks out the perfect amount of sound for outdoor running, such that I'm not distracted by ambient noise but I still have enough situational awareness to hear a car honking at me at close range- audio quality is better than any of my in-ear headphones, which is really all I needed in this case- battery life is great, I never find myself running out of battery even though I use these quite a bitCons:- My primary reason for deducting a star: I was expecting these to be over-ear, but they're actually more like on-ear; the ear pads are a bit tight and sometimes they start to hurt my ears after wearing them for longer periods of time, usually after ~45 minutes (I'd be especially cautious if you have any cartilage piercings)- It's a bit hard to use the control buttons sometimes- the double tap to skip is a little finicky, sometimes if I press too quickly in succession or not hard enough it doesn't register. The volume controls are so much smaller and so far to the top and bottom, respectively, that I sometimes accidentally hit the center pause button instead. Still convenient to have controls there, but they have room for improvement. I also find myself wishing that I could use the controls from either side instead of just the one, but that's not a big deal.- I worry that the band might be damaging my hair a bit, as it's a pretty grippy material. It's not pulling out any hair, but I do wish it had a bit more slip since the headphones feel tight enough to stay put regardless","Reviewed in the United States February 25, 2024",AHMFDYUZPJZD6H4D22HIWLJNTG4A,True,15,Color: Rose GoldStyle: Solo3Set: Without AppleCare+

I turn them off after every use and have not had to charge them yet.Pretty comfortable overall , I have worn them a few times for over an hour during hikes and walks outside. ( an hour and 45min at the most ) and found that my ears were slightly sore after that time frame but not painful at all.( I have not done any running in them)Lightweight and compact enough to take with me on the go-I didn’t like that I could not get them back into the small bag they came in easily. It seems to be a very tight fit to get them in and out even when they are collapsed fully so I have not been using the bag they came in for storage .Other than that they work great for my needs.","Reviewed in the United States April 10, 2024",AFDBDFGWMV6V4NKQXW3PFJ7RPVDQ,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: Solo3Set: Without AppleCare+

R2P3JRB3XRYY3I,B0CCBKGDJD,4.0 out of 5 stars the best headphones,Angel,4,"The best headphones. I was looking for the perfect headphones with the qualities of sound cancellation , durability, color and comfortability and I found the perfect ones. How i even found out about this product is because one day i was working out at the gym with my cousin and i need music loud enough and my airpods was not loud enough for me so me and my cousin swapped and i was so satisfied with the loudness of it and i was so focused and encouraged to finish my workout. I really like these because of the sound cancellation mostly , when I am doing my school work working out and I don't want to hear anything I put these on and everything on the outside just goes mute and the headphones just do their job. In a lot of headphones I feel like the advertisement is really fake. As someone who has tried the majority of wireless headphones this one is probably one of my favorites so far. But I do have some dislikes and likes about this product starting off with the dislikes . first thing i would like to start of with is how big the headphones are like there so noticeable and there just there i wish there were smaller nad like airpods sort of another dislike is u could hear the music out the headphones loud and clear so it's like whatever your listing to others can hear which i honestly hate that. Next is that you can lay down with them like if u were laying down on your ear its just super uncomfortable because like i said on how big it is. Now let's move on to the like starting off with the ear muffs they put on the headphone . The earmuffs are what makes this product super comfortable and if it's cold your ears will be warm because of the earmuffs. Next is the loudness of course like i said in the beginning and the sound cancellation. Finally, I love how this product has multiple colors and they are all beautiful but the color I have is just out of this world which is the pink rose gold color love love love this color is just such a pretty color and it's my type of vibe. My honest review for the headphone is 4.8/5 these are great headphones and they have everything you need in them i just personally don't like hoe big and bulky they are and how you can hear the music outside the headphones but other than that love this product and i highly recommend you buy this for a friend or family member or even yourself if your looking for a headphone with noise cancellation and loudness to it .","Reviewed in the United States November 28, 2023",AEOW7ZE5YPXQQLYVVXAFJ5WKTXLA,True,15,Color: Rose GoldStyle: Solo3Set: Without AppleCare+

RWAWWHNPITXJD,B0CCBKGDJD,4.0 out of 5 stars Unmatched Style and Performance,Eric W.,4,"I recently purchased the Beats Solo3 Wireless On-Ear Headphones, and I must say, they have left a lasting impression on me. From their sleek design to impressive sound quality and long-lasting battery life, these headphones have become my constant companion for both daily commutes and intense workout sessions.First and foremost, the design of the Beats Solo3 headphones is striking. The sleek and streamlined appearance, combined with the iconic Beats logo, exudes a sense of modernity and style. The headphones come in a variety of attractive colors, allowing users to express their personality and preferences. The on-ear design is comfortable and snug, providing a secure fit that stays in place even during vigorous activities.The sound quality is undeniably excellent. The Beats Solo3 headphones deliver a powerful and bass-heavy sound signature that suits various music genres. The bass response is deep without overpowering the vocals and trebles, resulting in an immersive audio experience. Whether I'm listening to my favorite tracks, watching movies, or playing games, the headphones never fail to impress with their rich and dynamic sound.The wireless connectivity is a game-changer. Pairing the Beats Solo3 with my devices is effortless, thanks to the Apple W1 chip. The Bluetooth connection remains stable and reliable, allowing me to move around without any dropouts. Additionally, the on-ear controls are intuitive and easy to use, enabling me to adjust the volume, skip tracks, and answer calls with a simple tap.The battery life of the Beats Solo3 headphones is outstanding. With up to 40 hours of playback on a single charge, I rarely have to worry about running out of power during extended use. Moreover, the Fast Fuel feature is incredibly handy, providing three hours of playback after just a 5-minute charge, perfect for those last-minute situations.The headphones also feature a built-in microphone, which works well for making calls and using voice assistants like Siri. However, the microphone's performance in noisy environments could be improved, as it tends to pick up background noise.Comfort-wise, the on-ear design may not be suitable for everyone, especially during prolonged wear. Some users might experience slight discomfort or ear fatigue after extended use, but this can be alleviated by adjusting the fit and taking short breaks.While the Beats Solo3 Wireless On-Ear Headphones deliver impressive sound quality and wireless convenience, the premium price tag might be a deterrent for some budget-conscious consumers. However, the product's performance and brand reputation are likely to justify the investment for audiophiles and fans of the Beats brand.In conclusion, the Beats Solo3 Wireless On-Ear Headphones are a stylish and reliable choice for music enthusiasts seeking powerful sound and seamless wireless functionality. With a few minor improvements in comfort and microphone performance, these headphones could easily score a perfect rating. If you prioritize style, sound quality, and long-lasting battery life, the Beats Solo3 headphones won't disappoint.","Reviewed in the United States July 24, 2023",AH6BBFPUMBAE5YUGOFBLLM7KBGLQ,True,86,Color: BlackStyle: Solo3Set: Without AppleCare+

They hurt my ears if they’re on for a long period of time but that’s usually how it goes for headphones. I will say that one small complaint I have is that my hair keeps getting pulled out due to strands getting stuck in the opening on the sides so it results in me having to carefully pull them out or they’ll get pulled. Another small complaint is that people can hear the music you’re listening to if you have it on high volume, but I tend to listen to music on high volume so that could be a me issue. Other than that I’m satisfied with the headphones and the sound quality and price is very agreeable :)","Reviewed in the United States March 2, 2024",AHSBGKKIP4UDGIBF7Y7ROTSVKWBQ,True,2,Color: BlackStyle: Solo3Set: Without AppleCare+

R2RAY6TSYGNK51,B0CCBKGDJD,5.0 out of 5 stars Best of 3 in comparison,Paul Ratzlaff,5,"I bought these flash sale for $41 versus the list price of 59.99 and compared it to the Raycon every day headphones which listed for 99.99 and I got through Black Friday sale for 69.99 and found the Raycons Had a better feel. The Life Q 20s had to be played with full volume on the phone did not connect automatically to Bluetooth like the Raycon did and they were not water resistant like the Raycons were. The Raycons had a more in-depth base about it and I liked the way the Raycons Told you that it was connected to the Bluetooth when you first put them over your ears. I could feel the sound better with the Raycons. The soundcore, Life Q 20s did not connect automatically and just gave you a series of bleeps to let you know it was connected. So construction wise and convenience wise and sound wise I found the Raycons better. I then compared the Raycons to a pair of beats solo3 which listed for 199 and you can get them at Costco in black for $99 which is what I paid for them in an Amazon cyber Monday sale. The sound quality of the beats solo3 was by comparison Superior to even the Raycons. If you set your phone volume to high, you can still adjust the beats up or down without it affecting the volume on your phone, whereas both the Raycon and the soundcore when you increase or decrease the volume it would increase or decrease it on your phone . I returned this product and spent the little extra money for the beats solo3 and am happy. But if you’re looking for a good sound for under 50 bucks the soundcore life Q20 is very good. For a price between 50 and 100 the Raycon fit the category and was great, and if you’re not afraid to spend the extra bucks, the beats solo3 is the best.","Reviewed in the United States November 27, 2023",AFDUE4P2K26EO2ZHXFVG4TUTJRGQ,True,14,Color: SilverStyle: Solo3Set: Without AppleCare+

R18SYH8M0MNZTT,B0CCBKGDJD,4.0 out of 5 stars Great Headphones but some cons.,Amazon Customer,4,"These beats are really great and the adjustable thing on the top really lets them fit nice on your head. And the sound quality is actually amazing. On top of that, beats and apple have some sort of connected/deal (idrk) and because of this, when you turn them on, they automatically pair directly to your iPhone (I have a 14) and don’t make you go thru any annoying pairing process every time. They also directly show the beats icon, connection, and battery life directly on your iPhone. You also get a free month trial of Apple music plus. My only issue is that the ear part that surrounds your ear is rather small, so this may be an issue, and it is for me. After a while, my ears kinda begin to feel annoyed or hurt because it is not encompassing my full ear, so I feel that either the price of them, they could maybe have made them a little bigger. And the travel case is also pretty small and tight. I am pretty sure beats has a more expensive and different option that does fully surround your ear but it’s pretty pricey. Overall these are great and easy to use headphones.","Reviewed in the United States January 20, 2024",AGQSAINEOWRMNFUFUMHQMLSOJJHQ,True,16,Color: BlackStyle: Solo3Set: Without AppleCare+

RUUJJA0TERA67,B096SV8SJG,5.0 out of 5 stars Compared to 4 other Earbuds...,Connor,5,"I bought these earbuds along with 4 other pairs, with the intent of comparing them over a couple weeks and returning all but my favorite. Here were the results:Beats Fit Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JL65GNM?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – These buds had some great base, and the wingtip gave them a fit that made them refuse to fall out of my ears. But the best feature? Physical “clicky” buttons on each one of the buds. You press in and hear/feel the click, rather than relying on a touchscreen-like feature. No need to guess if you tapped them once or twice, you will know.Cons – The wingtip gives a very sturdy fit, but not the most comfortable. I wouldn’t recommend to anyone with smaller ears. The noise canceling was solid, but nothing special. And this may be picky, but I didn’t care for most of the color schemes available. I prefer my earbuds to be hard to notice, and even the black ones have a bright red letter “b” in the middle.Beats Studio Buds - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096SV8SJG?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – Very comfortable with the same great physically “clicky” buttons as the Beats Fit Pro. Noise canceling seemed slightly better than average. Great base. Classic look.Cons – Tested during a workout, a little bit of sweat had these sliding right out of my ear. The case for these earbuds also was the flimsiest of any I had tested, with a very weak hinge that I was scared of breaking off within the 2 weeks of using.Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MWZHHKP?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – A neat feature that I noticed only in these earbuds was that it had noise amplification as well as noise cancelation. With one swipe in the app, the surrounding sound was actually louder and clearer than it would be without the earbuds in. Great if you are hard of hearing, or just enjoy snooping on conversations out of reach.Cons – Similar to the Beats Studio Buds, these didn’t stay in during a workout. They were usable, but every 10 minutes I found myself pushing them back into my ear. And this is an opinion, but these are the ugliest earbuds out of the bunch. The shiny black gleam made it look like a large beetle was hanging out in my ear. No visible brand placement either, which makes them appear cheap and generic rather than the quality Samsung they are.Samsung Galaxy Buds Live - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09TBM1L3S?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – Cost effective! I added these to the test group because of the unique shape, and for that they are worth giving a try. If you have small ears and do not like the rubber insert that is standard in most other earbuds, these may be perfect for you.Cons – Poor fit for large ears. These were tested the least of all of the buds, because the fit was so bad for my ear shape that they wouldn’t stay in if I turned my head too fast.Bose QuietComfort - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C4KWM9T?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – Bose noise canceling is unmatched. If your primary use for earbuds is to cancel out that background white noise, this is the pair for you. The sound quality is great, not too heavy on the base. The case for the earbuds stood out from the rest as the only one that impressed me. Felt very study, and I had no worries tossing it into a gym bag or cup holder. The only case with a button latch to make sure it doesn’t open accidentally.Cons – This was the most expensive pair of earbuds by a longshot, and there were still some things I felt could be improved. The rubber inserts had more of a “flayed” shape rather than the “rounded” shape that is standard. My guess is that this was by design, because the earbuds were also slightly heavier than others and may need that extra in-ear grip. The flayed shape did make them sturdier, but at the cost of them being uncomfortable in an active situation. They were also the largest earbuds, and stuck out from the side of my head further than I would have liked.My favorite? The beats fit pro! While I wouldn’t recommend this pair for everyone, it was perfect for my routine. My music taste benefits from the boosted base, and the wingtip shape was perfect for any workouts. The feature that really convinced me was the physical buttons, something that I didn’t realize how desperately I needed.","Reviewed in the United States August 11, 2022",AFEITP6Y25NKH3KB2LXWQCC7STIA,True,2066,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+
R3EO2GBST2UICI,B096SV8SJG,5.0 out of 5 stars Initial review and comparison to other brands,philip seitz,5,"I love these earbuds. They feel definitely worth the price and a all around great buy. Giving me exactly what I was looking for.For years I have used the raycon E55 and some of the features I loved about raycon was the manual button in the earbuds, excessive bass and great inside-ear fit.Recently however, raycon has gone the way of the world— they have put sensors on the earbuds in the place of buttons and Balanced out the audio. So I began my search for new earbuds.—THE SOUND—Both the AirPods, galaxybuds and raycons I have tried tend to be balanced and prioritize giving equal notes to all instruments For a clear and concise sound, But to someone who is not an audiophile it sounds very flat and devoid of the punch that I desire. For me- I want it to be great sounding but also noticeably bass heavy. These Beats Studio buds deliver. The company recognizes that your not using these to analyze a song. These are for the people who like bass and want to feel some gravitas in their ears!—CONNECTIVITY—These connect effortlessly to iPhone, as if they were AirPods. It was the single biggest factor that blew me away with these. They are incredibly easy to connect. I cannot speak for android but these work great. They do not have a lot of audio adjustments like Bose but I frankly don’t need them to. You can easily see the battery state on both buds and the case from a pop up window in your apple home screen whenever opening the case, just like AirPods.—FIT—The fit is not as good as the raycon E55 but only by a little bit. They fit snuggly in your ears well enough that they do not fall off when running and working out. Although adjustments might need to be made to them occasionally. (I have small ears, so the fit is review as such)—THE CONTROLS—The controls are simple and straightforward. They are just like what you come to expect from earbuds. Single tap, double tap, triple tap.The earbuds HAVE AN ACTUAL BUTTON… which I thought was extinct, I personally hate the sensor buttons because adjusting your earbuds in your ears would trigger the controls.While these do have a very sensitive physical button— it is easy to avoid while adjusting with practice.—BATTERY—The battery lasts me all day, what more do you want?—RANGE—Very good, about 30+ feet—CONS—-no MagSafe compatible charging-fit isn’t as perfect as some brands but is really good-if your an audiophile these earbuds are not balancedFinal call-If you like bass, and hate the sensor controls on most earbuds— these very well could be the best earbuds you could get. These are on par with earbuds in the 200$ range. And if your anything like me, you will love them! And if not, they might still be worth it to you—UPDATE—they have a hard time staying in when working out, and so I had to buy wing tips for these. They automatically have active noise cancellation on when you take them out of the case… which I personally hate.And the cases battery is pretty short lived… only lasts two days generally","Reviewed in the United States September 28, 2023",AFMDCDCHBIWSEI6RDYBCY4MXXVZQ,True,478,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+
R839TV3ECR12X,B096SV8SJG,"5.0 out of 5 stars Comfortable, great sound, and perfect amount of active noise cancellation",Phenix,5,"I ordered these on sale after my favorite earbuds’ case stopped reliably charging and found they had been discontinued. I have a hard time finding earbuds that stay in and don’t hurt my ears. I have a set of Bose over ear anc headphones, but I like having earbuds because I can stick them in my purse or pocket and always have them handy. I was really skeptical of these because I figured they were more branding and hype than performance- but I was pleasantly surprised. These have a lot more clarity of sound than I had expected in the high and mid ranges. I was afraid they would be very bass heavy at the expense of higher ranges, and was pleased that this wasn’t the case.Pros- 1. comfortable fit. I can wear these all day without my ears hurting. 2. Good sound quality. They are not Bose quality sound, but they also aren’t Bose prices. 3. Smooth Apple connectivity - this is the most noticeable difference compared to my other favorite earbuds. These connect easily and smoothly and work with Siri in ways my other earbuds wouldn’t. 4. Noise cancellation- great noise cancellation without completely drowning everything out. I sometimes use these in louder environments because the active noise cancellation works great to dampen loud environmental noises. I highly recommend these if you are someone who, like me, gets sensory overload when there is too much noise. These don’t have a noticeable humming/buzzing noise like I notice with Bose’ anc.Cons- 1. overly touchy controls on the earbuds. I have accidentally hung up on people several times when trying to adjust an earbud. 2. Definitely worth every penny of the sale price - I’m not sure I would pay the full ticket price for these but if you can catch them on sale, grab them. There are earbuds of comparable sound quality for substantially less cost, but these are definitely higher end sound. I would not consider them audiophile quality if that is what you are looking for, but they deliver a good, solid, quality sound. 3. Charging case- the charging case closes firmly, opens easily, and the slim rounded design means they fit in your pocket without being bulky.Overall, I love these and I have purchased so many earbuds that I end up never using because they either hurt my ears, fall out too easily, or have terrible sound quality. I can listen to music, videos, movies, and audiobooks and the sound quality works and transitions well for all of these different media types.","Reviewed in the United States February 2, 2024",AFNWZZIIVDVU5ZXMXWEKWPRQ7H6A,True,77,Color: Sunset PinkStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+
R2MOD3AIAL0RCQ,B096SV8SJG,"4.0 out of 5 stars Pretty good. Not GREAT, but not bad.",Papa Boots,4,"Whenever I see something with a 4-star review, it usually means it’s a solid product but there’s something (or somethings) keeping it out of 5-star range.For me, these are a perfect example of that. They’re small (good), not terribly obtrusive (only some out-of-ear-stick-out, tho your experience may vary), the sound has some solid bass which is helpful for the gym (where I tested these out), the sound overall is clear (download some equalizer apps to play with the sound itself), and they stayed in my ear well. I don’t know much about soundstage or whatever, but the sound itself is clear, bass is nice and strong, and you can hear even the subtle nuances like the shifting of a hand on guitar strings clearly enough without being disturbed. That, to me, is the sign of a good earbud.The transparency mode and noise canceling modes were alright. But that’s just it, they’re alright. Granted, the AirPod Pros have a higher price tag, so they do the ANC and Transparency mode much better. So it’s understandable that these would do the same, but on just the slightest bit of a lower level.I’m also spoiled bc the Airpod Pros have wireless charging. These DO have USB C, but the lack of wireless charging is a small thing, really. There’s something about being able to toss these on a charging pad and leaving them there to charge that’s just so satisfying. Also, was not a fan of how the case just doesn’t have that “premium” feel. The matte finish is nice, tho I would have liked a little more weight in the case lid, but at this point, these are such little (and I mean LITTLE) things that really, it’s not a dealbreaker.My only thing is the amount they stick out. I’m sorry, but they do look a little…funny, the way they sort of stick out just a bit so that the “b” logo is upright. They don’t stick out a LOT, but juuuuust enough that when you look in the mirror, you’ll see a vertical line where the physical button (which I have managed to press on accident a couple of times while adjusting the bud) sticks out. Also, I had a little difficulty getting them to stay in, but that’s beyond pretty much anyone’s control.These get that 4th star because of just how they are a solid enough product worth the purchase. They don’t do any one thing particularly well, but there are just enough teeny things for me that I wouldn’t say these are the best I’ve ever used. (For comparison, the Jabra 75t gets the equivalent of a 4.3 rating…the hear-through is amazing and their app really helps boost functionality).For me, these are SOLID gym earbuds. They play music loudly, clearly enough, and the bass is strong enough for me that I can drown out whatever annoying other music is playing outside. They fit and stay relatively well. For the price tag, you get some good bang for the buck. You could do worse, but at this range, depending on if you want to pitch in a few more, you could also do better.","Reviewed in the United States June 27, 2021",AECTDFXXCI5RLPDMMXH2ELH4LJVA,True,1625,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+

I have never had noise canceling headphones before, so my comparison is only to my skull candy ear buds (which I love but not for school). I would say they cancel out probably 90% of noise if on the lower end of volume. If used on higher volume then it’s probably 96%. There is still some sound sneaking in, but it’s not much. They hold their charge, and they fit my ears great which is hard because I have small ears. I bought them on sale and I love what I got for the price. I am not big into spending tons on headphones so I don’t think I would purchase at full price personally but I absolutely understand why someone would. The sound quality is great and they pair so fast to my iPhone. It was tricky getting them paired to my laptop, but that was minor.

R3OTWPP01KM2BY,B096SV8SJG,3.0 out of 5 stars actually disappointing,kimmy,3,"bought these after my airpod pros died on me suddenly. i have been using these beats studio buds for about 6 months and the experience has been inconsistent to say the least. first issue: they fall out of my ears if i do simple things like turn my head or chew. i can barely walk or exercise with them in because they just fall out. i looked online and it seems others have had these issues; people were suggesting swapping the size of the actual ear bud and even wearing them in reverse (with the left bud in the right ear and right bud in left ear). neither if these worked for me. really made me appreciate the airpod design.it was fairly easy to connect the very first time but every time after that is almost always a pain. if the case is dead but the beats themselves are still charged it’s like it doesn't recognize that the beats are still working and refuses to connect. even if the case is charged sometimes it just will not recognize that the beats are in range of my phone, even if they're sitting right on top of each other. if it’s not straight up refusing to connect it’s disconnecting randomly. if i open my car door - even with the car turned off - the beats automatically disconnect from my phone as if it expects me to connect my phone to carplay. there are many times i have been talking on the phone using my beats and suddenly they will disconnect.the controls only kind of work. you can use the default preset controls like pressing twice for skipping songs and once for hanging up calls and the like. however you're supposed to be able to customize these controls to in your phone settings but they only work as long as the beats are disconnected. as soon as you put the beats away and disconnect everything goes back to default settings the next time you reconnect. noise cancellation is a joke, it sounds the same as when its on transparent mode or off.the case feels like cheap plastic. i got a silicone case because i was afraid of scratching it up. not much else to say about it.the color of the beats are great. i got red and it looks super cool. i think the sound quality is on par with my old airpod pros. when i am on the phone others have not had a problem with not hearing me or me coming across muffled, so that’s a plus.overall, these earbuds are nothing special. i got these around the holidays when they were almost half off. glad i didn’t pay full price for these as they are disappointing at best.","Reviewed in the United States May 25, 2024",AFSUYJ3N2JAFCBPFF7G6VM5LLT5A,True,23,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+

It was easy to set up and pair and the sound is excellent. ""Transparency mode"", which allows some ambient sound, works very well without a huge impact on battery life. The only negative I can come up with so far is that the super high gloss finish on the buds can be challenging to grip, especially when removing them from the case. A light texture added just to the grip area would solve this without noticeably disrupting the cosmetics; something for the designers to consider.","Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2024",AGCJX4UIM2UJ4ZEAVA6EFZMQOJNA,True,1,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+
R3QIOBHH01818S,B096SV8SJG,4.0 out of 5 stars Ok but not excellent for Beats,Amy L.,4,"I bought these renewed so keep that in mind before reading further. Aesthetically, he quality of the product is good, arrived clean, in the original box with charger and manuals. I like the design of the case (small enough to tuck away but big enough to keep track of.) 10/10. The headphones performance though are just ok and that's coming from a long time Beats fan. I bought these specifically because I lost one of my Beats Fit Pro pods (special edition ones that I can't get replaced or don't want to pay 2/3 the cost to do), anyway, these were an affordable backup. Sadly, these particular beats are lacking in sound quality, battery life, and noise cancellation.-Sound quality: 6.5/10 overall for sound with music. The sounds is quite low, volume on the device playing needs to be almost at max to hear comfortably for phone calls or audio/podcasts. Expected more oomph like my other sets.- Battery Life: 6/10. I charged them fully the first night and used them for a 1hr workout and for a few hours of a work shift. The case and headphones were completely dead the next morning without charge. So only one full day of use on a charge which again is starkly different from my Beats Fit Pros that lasted for up to 5-7 days without needing another charge. Boo.Noise Cancellation: 4/10 Probably the most obvious and my least favorite feature of these headphones is the noise cancellation. Even with one headphone in, you can hear absolutely nothing in the surroundings. I know some would love this, but other Beats models have the ambient sound option that allows you to hear the headphone audio AND the surrounding area comfortable. I feel like I'm wearing a hearing aid with these.One perk: Unlike other beats these headphones are interchangeable (at least for me). I was able to swap ears which is nice.Overall Rating: 7/10-Not great, but not terrible. Ok for everyday headphones that aren't too pricey.","Reviewed in the United States June 12, 2024",AE4SCIH4EIJQNY4BA7TKFA7WD6IQ,True,0,Color: WhiteStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+

Transparency mode is supposed to make it easier to recognize sounds and voices so that you know when to unplug and listen, but it rarely works out that way with these.Score down on the battery life for the fact that the Transparency mode uses more battery but doesn't work well.That said the ANC works well and the audio quality for music (including Dolby Atmos), phone calls, and spoken word/podcast is superb.

R2FK2L6QM1M5F,B096SV8SJG,4.0 out of 5 stars Loved ❤️; but wish a bit more ❤️‍🩹,Mr & Mrs,4,"Loved the ear buds. I use it mostly to listen to music and podcasts while I work on chores. Here's my review after a week of usage. This Beats ear buds has :> Amazing sound quality (I'm not a music professional; so not sure about the little nuances).> Noise cancellation is really good. I could listen to my stuff, while my family watches TV in the same room. Even with the bud in one ear, the sound filtering and clarity are a lot better than what I expected.> You also get an option to turn on and off the noise cancellation. With the noise cancellation off (i.e., transparency) you can hear outside sounds clearer (not as clear as without the ear buds though).> There are options in the bluetooth settings page (iOS) where the ""press & hold"" function of the ear buds stem can be toggled between ""noise control / Siri"" and turn on ""volume control"".> Battery life is very impressive. For my use case to listen to podcast and music, it lasts for several hours (atleast so far).> When the buds are put in the case, it magnetically latches in the right position.> It fits perfectly in the ear. It has the soft eartips that works better than an airpod pro for me.> It has the ""Find My"" option to locate if misplaced.Just a couple of features that i wish were better if addressed:> Auto audio turn off when the buds are taken off of the ear / falls off the ear. The audio continues in these cases. I.e., if you're listening to a podcast, wants to take it off for a few min and keeps it in your pocket, it can very well turn on accidentally (because it needs only a soft click to turn on) and the podcast would be over by the time you put it back on 😆.> No auto-pairing which is a bit annoying. It automatically connects to the last device it was connected. Each time you need to switch to a new device, the connection has to be established manually.> The three clicks for rewind does not usually take in properly, unless you manage to do the three clicks quite fast. If there is a millisecond delay between the presses, it considers it as a single click which is a command to stop.> If you're connecting to the laptop (Mac), the option to use ""noise control / siri"" Vs ""volume control"" seems to be either-or i.e., you may not have both at the same time.","Reviewed in the United States December 27, 2023",AHWVZ7UB4TNBZUSSELY6RB7RRCUA,True,16,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+

RNDGVPHO1V4I5,B096SV8SJG,4.0 out of 5 stars Beats Studio Buds - A Symphony of Style and Sound,dwayne taylor,4,"I recently purchased the Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds, and after spending some quality time with them, I am thoroughly impressed. These earbuds are a fantastic blend of style, functionality, and sound quality, making them a strong contender in the crowded market of wireless earbuds.Design and Comfort:The first thing that struck me about the Beats Studio Buds was their sleek and minimalist design. Available in a range of colors, they have a modern look that stands out without being too flashy. The earbuds are incredibly lightweight and come with three sizes of ear tips, ensuring a comfortable and secure fit. I wore them for hours without any discomfort, which is a big plus for anyone who uses earbuds extensively throughout the day.Sound Quality:Beats has always been known for its emphasis on bass, and the Studio Buds do not disappoint in this regard. The sound is rich and immersive, with a well-balanced profile that doesn't overly skew towards bass. The mids and highs are crisp and clear, making these earbuds suitable for a wide range of music genres. Whether I was listening to classical, rock, or hip-hop, the audio quality remained consistently impressive.Noise Cancellation and Transparency Mode:The active noise cancellation (ANC) on the Beats Studio Buds is a standout feature. It effectively blocks out ambient noise, allowing for an immersive listening experience even in noisy environments. The transparency mode is equally impressive, letting in just enough sound to keep you aware of your surroundings without diluting the audio quality of what you're listening to.Battery Life and Connectivity:The battery life of the Beats Studio Buds is solid, offering about 8 hours of listening time and more with the charging case. The earbuds also support fast charging, which is a lifesaver when you need a quick boost. Connectivity-wise, they pair seamlessly with both iOS and Android devices, and the connection remains stable even at a distance.Controls and Functionality:The touch controls are intuitive and responsive, allowing for easy management of playback, calls, and ANC modes. I found the controls to be quite user-friendly, with minimal accidental touches.Conclusion:Overall, the Beats Studio Buds - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds are an excellent choice for anyone looking for high-quality sound, effective noise cancellation, and stylish design in their earbuds. They strike a perfect balance between performance and aesthetics, making them suitable for both casual listeners and audiophiles alike. While they may be a bit pricey, the quality you get justifies the investment. Highly recommended for anyone in the market for a premium wireless earbud experience.","Reviewed in the United States December 27, 2023",AGIAJSPIKY6ECFRXNA6BPVLSNG3A,True,11,Color: RedStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+

RGTK8PYYGJ2FG,B096SV8SJG,5.0 out of 5 stars The Best Bass I've Heard from Earbuds,Matthew hoffacker,5,"These earbuds pack an incredible punch, I rated the noise canceling a 4 because i notice a slight decrease in audio quality whilst on since the drivers are dedicating some of their power to canceling out whatever noise is playing.The Unboxing Experience: Apple does Apple really well. All of their products have an amazing unboxing experience curated for them. These lil guys are no exception, I even noticed the piece the earphones are attached to is like a inch thick piece of cardboard that feels more akin to metal than cardboard.THEY HAVE BUTTONS: Yes all of the major earbuds have controls on the units themselves but none that I've used have implemented buttons so well. These buds have a physical clicky button on each earbud that clicks with just enough pressure to negate accidental touches but not so much pressure that your shoving an earbud driver down your ear canal. Another instance of these buds implementing what others have better.From an Android user: These pair exactly like any galaxy buds would and or apple products to an iphone. You open the case and if you have bluetooth on it has a cool little animation of your product on the phone and its a one click pairing system. Incredibly easy.Connecting to a laptop: Your case must have a charge or be plugged in for these to pair to a laptop. Theres a button in between the buds that if held for 3 seconds sends the buds into a pairing mode where they function much like any other bluetooth product on the market.BASS: YES IT DOES.Price: I got these whilst they were on lightning deal for 79.99 and at that price they are unbeatable. I've come from multiple pairs of bluetooth earbud solutions such as Quiet comfort buds from bose, samsung galaxy buds orginial and pro and pro 2, and Ive even tried both airpod pros and standard airpods. With having tried all of these I see benefits to having one pair over the other but with that price being a major standout reason these buds are now my favorite option for wireless earbuds.OVERALL: These things are freaking sweet and if you can find them on sale you should most definitely be considering them as your next daily driver. Battery, Bass, android compatability, style points for someone who grew up in the early 2000s (used to love those big over ears hanging around my neck i thought i was so cool) and although i didn't focus much on their noise canceling in my review they do that well enough to switch on as needed. If you're trying to enjoy the sound quality of a song as much as possible i would just suggest getting ear tips that fit well and seal. Even with NC turned off these things seal so well I can barely hear my own thoughts - rather just bass rattling - just the way i like it.9.5/10 Really not much you could do better with them.","Reviewed in the United States December 31, 2023",AE6EQLGONN4MPXYFETOA3GDK7WBA,True,40,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+

I was struggling with wired earbuds and a new iPhone 15, which meant having to use an adapter, and I was frustrated by the ones I tried. I thought I would lose mobile earbuds but it's been a month, so far so good.For my primary use, listening to audiobooks, these work great. The sound quality is fine. I've listened to music—also fine.It comes with a few alternate earbud sizes, but none has been a perfect fit. One side or the other falls out when I lean over, so I have to make sure they're in good. When one falls out, I don't know why, but it's almost impossible to find, even though they're red. I've used FindMy a few times. I have to move the base and the other earbud into another room as far away as possible, and under a pillow, or I can't differentiate the FindMy beeps. But FindMy works great!Last week, while washing dishes, my left earbud popped out—into a bowl of water! I scooped it out immediately, dried it off, and planned to put it in a baggy with silica packets. I was sure I'd killed it. But I am not very patient. I popped it back in after a minute. It worked great!!They have an okay run time but I am often surprised when I hear the signal that means the battery is almost out. On the plus side, when I pop them back in the case for even 15 minutes, they charge fast. At night, I charge the case and within maybe 15–30 minutes, it's all charged up, so I can then charge my phone.I'm not sure that the background cancelling works well or that there's much if any difference, according to people I've been on the phone with.

Another positive is the controls on the earbuds work relatively well compared to many others. The problem comes in the fact that the sound will pop in and out intermittently while you are exercising or walking. The biggest problem I had and the reason for the low rating is that they will come unpaired sometimes if you pull an earbud out of your ear and they will not re-pair on your phone by turning Bluetooth on or off or anything else. The only way to get them to re-pair is to put them back in their charge box and pull them back out again. That doesn’t do any good when their charging box is hours away and you’re out exercising. The last time that happened to me, I took the earbuds out and threw them in the woods as far as I could throw them. I have a couple sets of wireless earbuds that don’t sound as well, but I would much rather have them as they are reliable.

R1GU45IQSBITVW,B096SV8SJG,"4.0 out of 5 stars Not great, but very good all things considered",Amazon User,4,"This arrived today, and these are my initial impressions. First, pairing with iPhone could not be easier. Also on the positive side, the kit comes with three sizes of ear inserts, so the fit is great. That said, insertion into the ear is not fool-proof, and it is easy to get them in upside-down. The sound quality is very good for earbuds (of course, they'll never reach the sound of all-around headphones). The volume control works well. If you've not used earbuds before, it takes some getting used to. As for noise-cancellation, not so great.","Reviewed in the United States May 13, 2024",AGZSH4PWEDRYSFI3RXFPN3TPAUTA,True,1,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+

The audio quality rivals AirPods Pro and the case is not as bulky as some other cheaper options. Depending on use, you can have a whole two days with no need of charging case. I have noticed as wear and tear comes on the charge hold lessens. The buds are comfortable but may occasionally slip out of ear if you’re doing extraneous activities. Other than that, great option if you want a reliable and good quality earbuds with a comfortable price range!","Reviewed in the United States June 10, 2024",AGGJGH2IJQ7JU5UPBWS7WTY7ZSZQ,True,5,Color: WhiteStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+

I even tried changing out the sized ear pieces it came with, but they still popped out. To be fair, I was moving my head a lot during workouts, so these would probably be fine for just walking or stationary listening. Also, I would not consider these noise cancelling, they block out sound, but do not actively cancel it.Great product, just not for my intended use!

R2VWVE6E3OMTBW,B096SV8SJG,3.0 out of 5 stars 6 month review,ashlee,3,"I wanted to wait a few months to give an honest review. I wear my earbuds quit frequently and here for the issues I've encountered with the Beat's studio buds. They did not come with an earpiece that was small enough to fit in my ears. I know that is probably a me issue and not necessarily the earbuds faults but do keep in mind if you have smaller ears, you may have trouble with these. Also, more than likely due to that, they did not stay in my ear very well. They constantly fell out of my ears all the time. I mostly use them for music or watching shows, but I do not think they would hold up very well if I was to go running. Also, the left ear bud was always cutting in and out with the sound. I'm not sure if I just got a faulty earbud or what but after a few weeks it stopped working more than it did. These are also not earbuds I would wear for an extended period of time either. They would start to hurt my ears after a while and were not very comfortable at all. The battery life was not great either. I feel like I was constantly having to charge them.All in all they were just okay headphones. I originally had airpod pro's and then they got water damamge. I got these when they went on sale instead of spending more money on a new pair of airpod pro's, however; after 6 months of discomfort and inconsistency with the sound, i did end up just repurchasing a new pair of airpod pro's. This was just my experience with the earbuds so like anything else take that with a grain of salt.","Reviewed in the United States June 4, 2024",AHQX6W5IM3N2KY6H6KCOQJTORMFA,True,2,Color: BlackStyle: Studio BudsSet: Without AppleCare+

In this case the Airpords are better. So putting your head on the pillow with the Beats bud sees your music pause more often than not when turning your head.

Full volume is painful, I see other reviewers complaining about the battery life at full volume and I have to wonder what their hearing is like.Battery: These will get me though a 12 hour shift, admittedly not listening to music the whole time and through a few hours of YouTube or TV when I get home. They charge extremely quickly too when the battery gets low. If I forget to charge them over night I can throw them on the charger for a few minutes at work and be fine for the rest of the day. The USB C port is annoying, I have an iPhone so I have to have two cables, but I also carry a USB C external SSD so I just use the cable from that with my laptop.Noise isolation: These things SHINE at passive noise isolation. Its like you have reusable earplugs in that just happen to have drivers. I work on cars a lot and work in a machine shop, so hearing protection is something I need to be wearing most of the time and something I want to have easy access to at all times. If I don't have my beats in my ears they're around my neck almost all day so if I'm about to do something I think will be loud, blowing out a hole with an air hose for example, I can throw them in my ears in seconds and have a decent level of protection. I wouldn't use these at a gun range but for me on a daily use basis they work great.Fit and comfort: When I'm running or working under a car the neck part likes to fall off. To get around this i put the headphones on upside down, with the usb port facing up, and then cross the ear bud cords in front of my neck so they still go in their respective ears. This is not how I normally wear them but it does work if I find myself in that situation. I had a set of airpods and they kept falling out of my ears, I switched back to these tethered style earbuds after one of my airpods fell out of my ears into a coolant tank. These stay in all day no problems because the majority of the weight is around your neck and not hanging out of your ears.Only part I dislike is the magnet in the buds, It attracts metal and gets stuck to stuff if you lean over. I don't think they're necessary but that's a monitor complaint.","Reviewed in the United States December 29, 2021",AHPJWKCJFO7EG3264AKO7HRLSSIA,True,64,Color: BlackStyle: Flex

R1H2UEHIZPSDYJ,B08QBCXZXP,4.0 out of 5 stars Great low budget bluetooth earphones,George wachsmuth,4,"So….Conclusion is…I really like these earphones.Fit: These fit in my ear well. You do have different size ear tips. Find the one that allows it to sit in your ear comfortably and that reduces outside noise.Sound: Contrary to what some people post, these earphones are plenty loud. I found that the maximum volume is different depending on what app you are using. Apple music will blow out your ears…YouTube is loud but nowhere near that volume.The bass, treble, and midrange are fine. As a matter of fact they are better than any other budget bluetooth earphones I have owned. I have owned several. I suppose if you are an audiophile you might not agree but I would ask why you would expect high premium sound from a 49 dollar pair of earphones?Durability: These seem fine to start with but not really rugged. Time will tell. Not water resistant. Don’t wear these in the shower or rain and you will probably be OK. If you are an excessive sweater….well….you could potentially have issues, I guess.Controls: Fairly easy to figure out but if you have large fingers they can be a bit of a pain in the ass. Still, they are usable.Battery life: Wow! These things last a long, long time once charged. I get more than 14 hours at higher volume. Another thing is how much quicker these charge than anything I have used to date.If you are not expecting the audio performance of 200+ dollar earphones, these are well worth buying.","Reviewed in the United States May 4, 2024",AE4KP4WAHTWOMAPA2EC45B4CX7LA,True,11,Color: Smoke GrayStyle: Flex

Super cool and smart packing 👍🏼.Charged them up fully and rocked out (which I am doing right now as I am writing this and jamming the Beats!). The magnet is strong that holds the buds together around your neck. Well designed with the fit around the neck. Tried them out at work all day today. They fit better than my last ones big time which is a huge plus for me.The sound is great to be…and this also depends on what platform you are listening on. I notice that if I upload a song I like from YouTube to Facebook and listen to it on Facebook it’s louder and better for some reason. So if I want to hear it loud that’s what I do.Overall I am a fan and would buy again.

In order to hear music while using power tools, I had to set the volume of my Bose Earbuds at ""5"", the Beats Earbuds allow me to set the volume at ""2"". My only ""complaint"" with these is the cord and it's more of a personal preference. I am a Profuse sweater, and Earbuds, no matter who makes them, have a nasty habit of popping/pulling out of my ears. I want/Need them to be corded together so I don't lose one when they inevitably fall out. The cord on my Bose Earbuds was perfect because it draped in front of my neck, the Beats cord drapes around the back and sticks to my skin after I start to sweat which causes the Earbuds to pull out of my ear from time to time. A minor annoyance but nothing to really ding Beats with. Yes, I will buy these again.","Reviewed in the United States June 13, 2024",AE4TGMOQ4XL3VC27YZREHKV6B4FQ,True,1,Color: Flame BlueStyle: Flex
R3K75G75IH0L2C,B08QBCXZXP,"4.0 out of 5 stars Outstanding value, switches to multiple devices including to Android, not audiophile quality",MDuck,4,"These are workhorse Bluetooth earbuds that I like better than Airpods, with a 5 star rating in every category except sound quality - and the only reason I deducted one star is because Apple is selling stuff that is truly audiophile quality now. They are ""almost"" wireless which is to say, no wire to device but there is a wire between the earbuds - for completely wireless you'll need Powerbeats at nosebleed pricing. No earhooks, but when fitted with the right size tips, they stay in place. You can keep them around your neck all day and only put them in when you decide to watch a video clip or take a call. They are comfortable for Netflix/Prime binging. They are hard to lose if you drape them over your neck. Apple Genius Bar replaces lost tips for free, but only in person.These sound better than Airpods, are a close match to Airpods Pro but without active noise cancellation, drape comfortably from the neck so they won't get lost (ever had an Airpod mysteriously slip out of your ear and lost it?) and if you choose the RIGHT SIZE ear tip, have EXCELLENT SOUND. With an undersized ear tip - like I had at first - there is inadequate bass. With a proper air seal, bass is excellent in an honest way, not pumped up artificially like old-skool Beats, with equally honest, balanced, mids and highs (you won't appreciate what they can put out until listening to some Dolby Atmos sound effects videos on YouTube). NOT fatiguing to watch videos for hours. Good sound stage and special effects with Atmos capable devices (Apple iPad/iPhone with A10 chip or higher, Fire HD 10 current edition, Fire HD 8 current edition) on Atmos encoded sound tracks (FWIW, Atmos is Dolby's effort to provide 360 degrees of sound effect from just earbuds - and it's surprising how well it ""fakes"" normal surround sound from multiple speakers, front and rear). (Also try Windows Sonic for Headphones, free in Windows 10, buried in sound card settings.)Where Beats Flex are outstanding is price - under $50. That's equivalent to knocking $100 off the first-release BeatsX which rolled out at $149.95 in 2017. And convenience. Unlike conventional Bluetooth earbuds, which have to be endlessly paired and re-paired to use with different devices, Beats Flex will pair with ALL your iPhones and iPads and Macs provided only that they are signed into the same iCloud (Apple ID) account. On Android, you download an app, and so long as you have the app you don't even have to be signed in under the same Google ID. With Windows 10 - sorry, conventional pairing and repairing.With a device you just used (or used yesterday), logging in and connecting is automatic - device power on, Flex power on, you are connected. If you move to a different device, whether Apple (with same Apple ID) or Android (with Beats app running), you first need to click on Connect (even if the device flashes a signal that it notices the Flex). It's easier done, than described.You can also share audio with a friend's Apple device - two headphones paired to one phone or pad.There are some controls, but all I ever use is the magnetic clip attachment between the rear of the two buds, to sleep and to pause playback on the iPhone or iPad. And the off button, when a session is over.Battery life is great. I can watch videos all day and night, the battery lasts longer than I do. Or, on saner schedule, go several days without a recharge. Compare that to 3 or so hours from some indie, cheapo (but good) Bluetooth earbuds (hook over ear style).Charges with a USB C cable (included) so one more cable to carry, but ultimately greater compatibility and fewer cable-wars (Apple is taking baby steps to kick Lightning to the curb and focus on C).HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Cheap, good sounding, wireless, over-the-neck earbuds with Apple quality. Wow.Caution: I have some sync issues with VLC video playback (but not YouTube, Netflix, Prime). It's easy to fix by adjusting the sync delay setting in VLC. I don't have these sync issues with MPow Flame airbuds. I think the Flex emphasize audio quality over perfect sync, that or VLC and Flex don't play nice with each other. Anyway its annoying but easy to fix, and I suspect the programmers at VLC will eventually take care of it.","Reviewed in the United States March 20, 2021",AE7P6HRZSF2LA5WAOZDKZVWBNPMQ,True,84,Color: Smoke GrayStyle: Flex
R3CLZSTJFEDC27,B08QBCXZXP,5.0 out of 5 stars These are the all day headphones for WFH,Scott P,5,"I got my first pair of Beats Flex as a preorder in 2021. Loved them. When I transitioned to work from home, these became my go-to for all the Teams calls because the battery truly can last the entire work day. They met their demise a couple months back when I accidentally squished them and the housing popped apart. So of course I got another pair!Here’s the details. These are super light Bluetooth earbuds with a thin, flexible neckband and a pod that sits on either shoulder. The left one has the charging port and volume controls, the right has the on off button. The pods themselves are very light and you get a set of tips to customize the fit. Water resistant? I don’t know, but the charging port doesn’t have a cover. Sound? Really nice. No fancy features like noise cancelling, and in testing with my first pair ambient noise and rustling from rubbing against clothing can interfere with phone calls, but for a work environment they are perfect.Look, if you want a decent pair of Bluetooth earbuds, don’t want to spend a lot, and don’t mind that the bells and whistles category isn’t well populated, these are what you want.","Reviewed in the United States July 9, 2024",AH4PSXM37DZE3MYDJ2IAA3SUUXRA,True,0,Color: Yuzu YellowStyle: Flex

I wouldn't consider these noise canceling.-If they fall out of my ear, I don't have to worry it falling down an elevator crack or in the toilet bowl.- Beautiful Color!- Easy to clean: Since these headphones are closer to my face, my foundation does rub onto the headphones but with a quick Clorox wipe, it's clean!- Various ear tip sizesCONS:- They don't automatically connect apple product to apple product the way AirPods seamlessly to. Meaning, if I am watching something on my iPad, the sound doesn't automatically connect to my iPhone- which is okay, but I have to manually go into Bluetooth settings and connect the headphones on each device.-Also when I charge the headphones, and reconnect on my devices I have to re-add the device to my Bluetooth as if they were new.

Discovered a couple, to me, significant deficiencies, since my original review.1) Battery life is far lower than rated 12 hour. getting about 8, maybe. Mostly listening to podcasts.2) Lack of low battery warning. If there is one, I never heard it. The other earphones I have used all have clear warnings , usually stating '20% battery remaining' and such. I have not had any warning, and ran out of battery 2 times so far.3) the buttons on the neckband are really not logical, or marked what they do.4) battery indicator is on the other side of the neckband than the charging port. Not a big deal, just odd.5) no 'over top of ear' wire routing like others I have used. Just a preference.6) I miss having an add-on charged battery to greatly increase the use of the product without having to find a charging port. Not easy when out of the home/car.On the positive side, I have found the phone function and quality is very good. No complaints from anyone I have talked to about the sound quality on my end. Most headsets I have used were bad to very bad. These are very good.From a dead battery, I charged about 20 minutes, got about 20% battery (according to the app). I guess that is pretty good. Using the headset as i type. Battery is now 15% after about 25 minutes of use (podcast listening)Still don't like the neckband. Prefer over top of ear, tight around the head wire style with nothing on my neck.Still, the sound quality for music, when equalized using your music app, is very good. Sound and mic quality are very good for phone.The business end of this set is there.Original review below:Coming from an older pair of similar Jaybird headphones.

Initially, I thought they were horrible. Turned on the EQ in Amazon Prime Music, which fixed that ! Out of the box , the sound is unimpressive, to say the least. Not crazy about the semi-rigid band. I liked the all wire of the Jaybird, as you could have it conform to your head with no movement for a real nice fit, making you even forget you had them on. These, you always know you have them on, as you can feel them on your earlobe and on your neck.Even with the annoyances, will give it 5 stars. Will revisit the review if there is any significant updateNutshell, they are almost identical to a $15 set I have, in all respect except these do sound a lot better. Is it worth the price... ehhh I don't know. As I listen to music writing this, I am liking them a LOT less than my old Jaybird Freedom.

I can leave my phone charging and go all around my house, down to the basement and outside and it’ll still be connected. The ONLY gripe I have about these is powering it on can be kinda annoying because you have to hold it for a second and the sound it makes letting you know it is on is like a solid 15 seconds after you hit it. Which doesn’t sound like much but it sometimes leads to to believe I didn’t turn them on and I inadvertently turn them back off. But idk about that at all compared to how great these are in every other way! Love these. Gonna purchase backups for sure!!","Reviewed in the United States March 28, 2024",AEJTHLEMPRXOWATMEC2OS45HJ46A,True,10,Color: Flame BlueStyle: Flex
R3EFB3BPYJPV1I,B08QBCXZXP,4.0 out of 5 stars Good for the price,A,4,"I bought these earbuds hoping they would work for overnight. The blue is cute but I would like to find some more discrete earbuds made in flesh tones or brown that would blend in with my hair color. Anyway, on with the review.Pros: The sound is good, comparable with my wired earbuds. Pairing was easy once I understood I needed to hold the button until the light flashed to get into pairing mode. They come with many earbud tips so I got a very comfortable fit and the bud itself is small enough for a side sleeper. They get plenty loud. As in, louder than most Bluetooth earbuds and I’ve tried many.Cons: the battery life is only 7 hours for me. I took off a star for this because I wanted them to last through the night and they didn’t quite. They are advertised as 12 hour battery and I was hoping to get at least 10 so this was disappointing. They seem less sturdy than my sound peats force pro which remain my favorite neckband earbuds. The controls are different from all my other earbuds and placed on the left side instead of the right, which is confusing. I’m sure if I used these daily I would get used to that but I probably won’t, since I had to switch back to wired at 4am when the battery died.In conclusion, these aren’t bad but they could be better. I’d be willing to pay a little more for a longer battery life.","Reviewed in the United States February 15, 2024",AHJSDXRH7NMFQOCBACIRUNJD7STQ,True,4,Color: Flame BlueStyle: Flex

R4VQ85W5KGDH,B08QBCXZXP,4.0 out of 5 stars Good - but not quite as good as the older version,jtprime,4,"These comments apply to Beats Flex released in late 2020.I got this item to replace a set I bought in early 2020 from another store. That set was great, but the left bud housing cracked when I fell asleep while wearing them. Besides that lack of durability and phone call quality, I liked the original product enough to repurchase it (at a sale price). Even so, I have some issues with the new set. My impressions are below.Connectivity: These Flex does not connect as easily to my phone nor remain connected as reliably for listening (see the phone audio quality comments below). I use these Flex with the same phone as before, but the performance aspect of the new Flex is not as good. I believe that the Android Bluetooth settings and the Beats app (Android) interact differently with the new Flex. Where the older Flex seemed to connect quickly, these new Flex require different user actions. Finally, on this point, I have not linked these to my Macbook; however, my old Flex worked flawlessly--and sounded great with the Macbook.Sound quality: These Flex sound good, but the bass is a bit wanting. I prefer a prominent low-end response, and the low-end on the Flex does not sound as good as the previous set. The highs and mid-range are clear, crisp, and not harsh or too bright, even at higher listening levels. I have not listened to Apple Spatial Audio content. The Dolby Atmos feature sounds about the same compared to the older Flex.Phone audio quality: These Flex sound great and are superior to the quality of my older Flex. The difference is dramatic. The connection during phone use is stable and quiet with little noise.Comfort: These Flex are less comfortable because the cord between the buds seems shorter or less flexible. I haven't concluded yet. The ear tips also seem harder and do feel as comfortable. If I find my broken set, I will swap tips. My initial perceptions of (dis)comfort may be due to insufficient break-in time. If I determine this is the case, I will update this point.Battery performance: The new Flex provide long listening time. I have frequently gotten more than 12ours of non-continuous use between charges. I am pleased by the battery performance.Other features/Accessories: Flex comes with an assortment of 4 different-sized eartips and a USB-C to USB-C cable for charging Flex. The cable is much too short for my use, being only about 4-6 inches in length. I have not used the cable because it is inconvenient, and I do not own a USB-C charging adapter; however, I have a suitable adapter supplied with my phone. In the box, as they say, should be a longer cable and an appropriate adapter.","Reviewed in the United States September 4, 2022",AEKC76H2UOWMRYSCFCPGMWD34C4A,True,23,Color: BlackStyle: Flex

R22E17WQO84WEZ,B08QBCXZXP,"4.0 out of 5 stars Good earbuds, but don't count on Find My feature",Shopsmith,4,"Good pair of earbud for an iPhone, but with a flawed implementation of ""Find My""PROS:- Sound is very good.- Pairs easily when turned on.- Good for small ears - Good selection of ear tips. I can't wear the huge hard plastic iPhone buds. I swapped out the tips for the small ones that were included, and they work well for me. (For reference, the only buds that have been comfortable for me have been the wired ""Yurbuds"" but their wireless buds have mixed reviews, so I didn't get them. )- Convenience of having the buds wired together and have them be magnetic: much less likely to lose them when you take them out, since I can just keep them around my neck.- Earbuds turn off when I take them out of my ears to preserve battery life.CONS- ""Find My"" feature is almost pointless here. Yes, it exists, and, if you're at home, the map will show that they are at home with you (or not). Basically, it will tell you where it last saw them -- Ie, the last time they were on and pairable with your phone... But the buds are not tracked if they are off, which -- due to power-saving functionality -- they are off as soon as you take them out of your ears... So the buds cannot be located (or made to make a locating sound) unless they are (1) on and (2) pairable. I don't know if you see where I'm going with this, but I can tell you that when I need to find my ear buds is not normally when they are on and paired to my phone - that's usually when I know exactly where they are. That said, the functionality is worthwhile if they get lost or stolen and SOMEONE ELSE turns them on and pairs them with their phone. So it's not a complete waste, but it's not what I was hoping for. So one star down for that.- Other than that, I'd love to see more (and nicer) bright color options, since that's going to be the primary way of finding them around the house in between use. Getting black or whitish gray is just going to blend with everything. Which leaves yellow or baby blue - which, meh. I would have chosen yellow had I known about the Find My shortcomings, but a nice strong red, or orange, or green would mean that I would have chosen color on its own merit, which would be nice.RECOMMENDED? Yes, but get one of the bright colors so you can find them around the house when you need them.","Reviewed in the United States March 28, 2022",AGUUE6KHRQR5CAHT3GALANGTM3RA,True,2,Color: BlackStyle: Flex

I wanted to purchase them again, but it seems like all Beats products now are wireless, so I tried their earbuds. I wasn't a fan of how they fit in my ears (prefer the Apple Air Pods), but still my tried and true was the Beats wired headphones for sleeping (I like to listen to white noise and sleep stories at night without waking everyone else up). I decided to give these a try. I will say they are very comfortable to wear, even at night, so that's a plus. Also nice how they don't really fall off since they are around the neck. The major drawback for me is they only stay paired to the device for short periods of time. I'm constantly having to re-pair them to the same device that I use them with every day. I wish they would auto connect like the Apple Air Pods, or even the Beats ear buds. If they did, they'd be five stars! It's just a drag having to re-pair them after only a few hours, in the middle of the night.","Reviewed in the United States April 20, 2024",AHOMPJDREBTPUE7BRYPKG7UDBJ4Q,True,3,Color: Smoke GrayStyle: Flex

R7DQZP3ILETG0,B08QBCXZXP,2.0 out of 5 stars Annoying Bluetooth on Android,Blondepetals,2,"There's a couple things that are very annoying with these earbuds.First, when you hold down the power button and the unit turns on, it doesn't make a notifying sound like all other earbuds I've ever used do. You have to pull them out of your ear and look for the light on the button.Second, they do not automatically connect to my Google Pixel 6.i have to go into Bluetooth settings and manually connect each time I turn them on. Again, no other pair of Bluetooth earbuds I've ever used operates like this. When you are used to these things just working, it's very frustrating when they don't.Once they are connected it does make a sound, but since I'm already looking at my screen, I can just see whether they connected or not. The notifying sound should really be for power on and power off.One more annoying thing; the battery life of the beats is not shown in my phone, Even when I got to Bluetooth settings and look directly at the beats. The only way I can tell what the battery life is, is by installing the Beats app. Which, from what I can tell, is it's only function or purpose.There is also no cover to the USB C charging input so I expect that to get called with lint and dirt from pockets.As far as good things go, I guess the sound is fine considering the price point. Not as good as Sony WI-XB400 though and they are similar price (if you can find them).Overall, I would not recommend unless you are fine with Bluetooth annoyances each time you use them. For me, it's too much and will be returning.","Reviewed in the United States June 15, 2024",AHEA7ZG5JHZNPFG3LG4PQBJIUWPA,True,1,Color: BlackStyle: Flex

When they are magnetized together it will pause your music! Very cool and handy! They are perfect and they have great sound!! They also come with lots of little ear tips for different size ears!!

I love these headphones when they work. They sound awesome and I would keep buying them if they weren’t all defective. I have tried three times to purchase new ones. Twice new for my daughter a little over a year ago. And now once refurbished as my older pair lost Audio on one side. All three times I had the same problem. When plugged in with the charger, the LED will indicate a full charge but after unplugging, the headphones are completely unresponsive. It appears that there is an issue with battery after so long and I don’t think that they are making this model anymore. I ended up buying my daughter the Beats Flex instead which has worked fine. I just likes the Beats X better because it used a lightning port instead of a USB C. It was just easier to keep one kind of charger where I needed it and not have to swap them out. Unfortunately it looks like they are all nearing the end of their lives and I will have to go with the Flex model instead.","Reviewed in the United States February 5, 2024",AEJMZB4OIAADGRJEHZWLEJOM2Z2A,True,1,Color: Black

I love them because they’re like the only set that fit and stay in my ear comfortably. I hate them because just making the two earphones connect magnetically doesn’t hang up calls. I also don’t like that I can’t answer calls just by pulling the headphones apart. Another thing I don’t like is that they still play while magnetically connected andddd if I’m watching something on my phone it doesn’t just switch from my phone to head set by pulling them apart.

Wrong charger* sent.,Dan King,4,"I rate the actual headphones 4 overall, but I bought these refurbished and the company sent me the wrong charger, so -1 star for that.These are light, and fit in my ears well so I barely notice I'm wearing them. I also really like the magnets that join the earbuds together when I'm not listening to them. I know it doesn't really make much of a difference, but they feel secure and like they won't just fall off me.My one complaint is the position and size of the power button. It's difficult to find by touch most times. It's a tiny tiny button that is pretty close to level with its enclosure, so even if you do find it by touch, you can't really tell if you are even engaging the button or not. It's a bit annoying and seems like a simple UI fix.Aside from that, the sound is pretty good. Not great, but these are earbuds and I'm willing to sacrifice a bit of sound quality for the compactness and portability of these.*UPDATE: The company promptly sent the correct charging cable.","Reviewed in the United States February 1, 2019",AF7QPBH363WT2JTSIR7HQSA2GJUA,True,4,

I typically buy skullcandy for price point and durability, and had decided to splurge this once and see if beats might improve my experience since I use them so regularly. Unfortunately, the outcome was quite the opposite. Their battery life is laughable, the Bluetooth just decides when it wants to connect or disconnect, they are the opposite of intuitive or user-friendly, they give almost no notice of low-batter and give no easy way to check battery life while in use, my list could go on. They are the most inferior bluetooth headphones I have ever owned or used. I do not recommend these headphones to literally anyone.

R26FH5W4R8PK5A,B07YVYNM3N,"5.0 out of 5 stars Good looking and sturdy -- a touch too tight on the head, more muted bass than before",Gregg Re,5,"Overall, really love these -- a solid upgrade to the solo 3's, and songs sound noticeably fuller on the pro's. They compare favorably to the Sony XM3's but each has specific advantages over the other. The Sony XM3's sound a bit better overall for classical/jazz music and are more comfortable, but are less ideal for exercise (as solo's have punchier bass for rap/pop/hip hop,+, water resistance, pair more easily w/ multiple devices.)IMPORTANT NOTE!!Concerning the fit ... these are surprisingly much tighter on my head than the Solo 3's, and I could see this being a total dealbreaker for some people. It took me a couple days to get used to it, and now I don't mind as much as I initially did. I'm not sure if it loosened up, but I don't think so -- I just think I adjusted. But, there is no question that for comfort, I would rather listen to my sony 1000XM3's for a very long period (1 hr+). For shorter listening, I really like these. The clamping force helps with the noise-cancelling, but it's also very very noticeable, even when I extend these out to their max-level of extension. Note that I have a larger size head, and wear glasses.Probably my favorite little feature: Because these automatically power on when opened, and power off when closed, you never have to fuss with a power button like you do on other headphones. When I go for runs, I just grab these, put them on my head, and start up music on my Apple Watch, and it quickly connects automatically and starts playing. It will quickly join any other Apple device you want, as long as it's on the same account. With the latest iOS, you don’t even need to go to the device menu — these headphones [like airpods] will auto-connect as soon as you start using another device. For instance, if I’m on my iPad listening to the solo pros, then close my iPad and go to my iPhone, the beats solo pros transition seamlessly to the iPhone. When I'm done, I fold them and put them down. This is more convenient than my XM3's, which only remember one device for Bluetooth.Some other nice Apple-specific benefits: When these are on, the headphones will automatically read out any texts ou get, allowing you to reply by voice without having to take out your phone. And, you can ask Siri to turn on or off noise canceling and transparency mode by voice, without messing with setttings.The sound quality is similar to the Solo 3's, but the bass, for lack of a better word, feels 'tighter.' It's still punchier than the bass in my Sony 1000xm3's, but it feels less like the low rumble of the Solo 3's. Instead, the bass in the Solo pros feels more like one component of the song. For shorter listening periods, I prefer the Solo Pros to both the Solo3's and my Sony 1000xm3's.The Solo pro's can get very, very loud without distorting the low end at all. The Solo 3's are not terrible by comparison, especially for workouts, but the bass feels less precise and the soundstage more limited. Given a choice between the Solo 3's and the Pros, I would pick the Pros every time -- BUT, when I use the Solo 3's, I still think they sound pretty good.One huge plus: The Solo pro's have sweat resistance -- woohoo! I can take these running. For many reasons, I would not take the XM3's running.These look incredible and have a far better, sturdier feel than the Solo 3's. As mentioned, a major advantage of these headphones for Apple users is that, like the Solo 3's, Airpods, Powerbeats, etc, these will pair with your apple account and are instantly accessible from any apple device tied to that account.I do love the passthrough mode, which uses the microphones to pipe sound into your headphones for when you need to hear ambient sounds. It's surprisingly significantly better than the one on the Sony 1000mx3's I have, and I think the noise cancelling is roughly similar. Really, the passthrough mode here (which you activate with a single press on the underside button) is almost crazy good -- doesn't feel like you're listening to microphones at all.The noise cancellation, with or without music playing, is also solid. With sound playing, like the XM3's, you won't hear much. It seems not quite on par with my Sony's XM3, but it's just very hard to be more specific than that. Jims' Review Room and Sound guys have a more comprehensive analysis that comes to a similar conclusion, but they do great, especially for canceling the low end.A double press on the solo pro's underside button will disable both passthrough mode and noise cancelling, doubling battery life to 40 hours. In this mode, outside sounds are partially muffled by the headphones' seal on your ears.The new iOS update also allows you to control these settings in the menu.I appreciate that music controls -- pause, play, Siri, next song etc -- are done using clicky and responsive physical buttons on the earcup. The Sony's touch interface has a big problem in winter and wet environments, due to condensation, and I had a lot of mis-presses with those.Love the way they auto-power off when folded. I don't mind the lack of a headphone jack.I prefer these to the Powerbeats pro, because those got earwax in them and always seemed to pop out, no matter which of the ear caps I used. The sound quality is a bit better as well. For weightlifers, you might want to check out the power beats pro, as they get in the way a bit less than on-ear headphones like this.Lastly, the carrying case is super cheap and not at all sturdy, which is disappointing.","Reviewed in the United States November 1, 2019",AHXW5L5IYS62YPLRRWAE3Z3HTTCQ,True,318,Color: Gray
R295E8YYJCXFL1,B07YVYNM3N,5.0 out of 5 stars Decent pair of headphones for workout and commute,Davit,5,"Seamless pairing with an iPhone (like Airpods) and really decent noise cancellation (compared to Airpods Pro noise cancellation is much stronger). But this headphones are very uncomfortable, they cause pain in ears if you wear them too long. Also they are surprisingly quiet, i have to crank the volume to 80-90% to to reach enjoyable loudness (same AirPod Pros seem to be equally loud and have better volume curve). Overall i was expecting an update in sound quality department, but Airprod Pros sound as good if not better despite being so tiny. And they are so much more comfortable. For everyday use and gym I would go with Airpod Pors for sure. I wish I could return these Beats, but month has passed, so whatever.[Update]After using Solos for several weeks you get used to the clamping force. Regarding sound quality, i take my words back, they do sound better than AirPod Pros, after spending some time with Solo I cannot use AirPod Pros for anything but podcasts and YouTube. It takes some time to appreciate the SQ, but once you do, there’s no going back to AirPods.","Reviewed in the United States September 22, 2020",AHP4MGHZ4CJGIWKHDBO5437M5MBA,True,14,Color: Black

As always, quality of music nowadays depends highly on the streaming source. YouTube is quite frequently the bottom of the food chain compared to other streaming platforms but these headphones make even YouTube better.Aside from YouTube, the sound quality is amazing and clean. The noise cancellation is on point and helps in creating that concert atmosphere without the sound of being in a tunnel. The best part of the noise cancelling is when my kids come to complain to me and I just smile at them, absolute heaven!! 😂I wear them quite often and they are easily the comfortable I’ve worn. Adjustment is simple and solid, no clicks to hit and you can get the right fit.The controls on the headset themselves are great and easy to figure out (I’m not a direction reader). The ability to fold them up makes it even better as they take up less space.I have two other Beats products and they haven’t let me down yet, hoping these headphones follow suit.

I really liked the sound quality and noise canceling, though, so I wanted the exact same thing but in an on ear headphone. That’s exactly what the beats solo pros are.I read some reviews saying they are small and uncomfortable but they fit me perfectly. I’m an average 5’7” woman, just for size reference.I have no connectivity issues like I did with the airpods. The battery life is fine but I put them on the charger throughout the day when I’m not wearing them. And I wear them most of the day.Also, I just like the look of them.

RGU68MCYR49CC,B07YVYNM3N,4.0 out of 5 stars Surprising Use!,Amazon Customer,4,"This is my first modern headphones purchase. I mostly use old (like from the 90's) Sony open air on ear headphones.You know, the kind that used to come with portable CD players back in the day. Anyway, I needed something with a mic so when I'm making calls or streaming games, everyone else doesn't have to hear what's going on in the background (I'm looking at you cat...) I was using the earbuds that came with my iPhone, but those aren't really comfortable, and the sound quality isn't that great for long sessions of gaming and streaming.Rather than just spend the big bucks on a gaming headset I wanted something that I could take ""outside"" and not look completely ridiculous.After narrowing it down to a couple different brands, these popped up on sale for $50 off so I figured I would give these a try.Turns out these are actually pretty good. The sound is very good, considering that these are Bluetooth headphones. It's a very balanced profile. Not the crazy treble of the old open air 90's headphones, and not the extreme bass of an early 2000's civic rocking 15"" subs.I listen to a much broader variety of music these days, so the balanced profile works well for me.Fit and finish is very good on these. There's a lot of plastic, but it's been covered with ""soft touch"" material.While they don't show fingerprints very much at all, body oils (bald folks will understand) do build up on them.I find a quick wipe down once a week with a baby wipe keeps them looking good, and keeps them from sliding around.As far as fit goes, this is going to be hit or miss for you. As pretty much everyone has said, these do fit tight on your ears, and it can get uncomfortable. The biggest problem I have had is with wearing glasses. They do very much smash your ears into the arms of your glasses and it doesn't take long to start hurting and become irritating.Now, I have found that due to how tight they fit, and the fact that my glasses are big, I can just rest the temples of them above the cups of the headphones, and alleviate all the issues. I can usually wear them for a several hours like this and be fine, as opposed to mere minutes wearing glasses normally.Bluetooth range on these has been much better than expected. I've tried earbuds that wouldn't even stay connected to the phone in my back pocket, let alone across a room. I've had these stay connected to several hundred feet away (outside in a rural setting) and had no issues in my apartment in a massive complex, with more wifi and wireless signals than a spaceship. Bluetooth has definitely come a loooong way.Now, if you've made it this far in the review, you're probably wondering what the surprising use is.Turns out these are the best thing ever for apartment living, and that's because of the noise cancelling. I've never seen/heard anything like this before.Downstairs neighbors drinking and fighting again, noisy kids playing in the breezeways, people who can't bother to get their car alarms fixed, barking bass dogs... you get the idea.Just one touch of the little magic button and all that goes away.You can't really sleep in these, but I've used them more than a few times now for afternoon naps on weekends in the recliner. Put some lite rock, or nature sounds stuff on, and next thing you know it's dinner time.I've also used them without any music, just on and connected to block out noise.Be prepared though for a heart attack if you should happen to get a text or call. It's pretty brutal if you've fallen asleep.Now to be fair these don't block out all sounds, but the do bring it down to a level that is more than manageable.I've also found these to be fantastic for doing laundry in the apartments laundry center.I'm one of the few people who stay and wait with their stuff, and the noise cancelling is just outstanding for blocking out broken dryers with belts squealing, off balance washers, banging and crashing of unsecured plumbing etc. etc..Battery life is excellent. These tend to get better than advertised life for me, but I don't listen to stuff at a very loud volume. I'm at maybe 25-30% volume level, 90% of the time.If you can snag these for $250 or under, I would absolutely recommend giving them a try.With amazon's excellent returns policy you don't really have anything to lose. Just be sure and give them a couple of extended wear sessions before that window is up, as the tight fit can be especially irritating if you wear glasses.","Reviewed in the United States March 9, 2020",AGG6QQW2HHC7PCEXHYWRWA2QB2WA,True,28,Color: Gray

R1WZJCFNTOZVZN,B07YVYNM3N,4.0 out of 5 stars Enjoyable after shifting from Powerbeats Pro and Solo 3s,Nick K.,4,"Pros(pun not intended):ANCH1 chipCan charge while wearing with a lightening cablePremium feel compared to solo 3s (must be the pros)Cons:Soft caseMay put too much pressure on head based on head typePrice (purchased on sale)End result: H1 chip and ANC make up for shortcomings, give them a try.I really enjoyed the Powerbeats Pro, they were very convenient, but the earbuds would irritate my ears something fierce after long listening sessions, so I decided to try solo 3s, which sounded good, but there was too much outside noise interrupting my listening sessions unless I turned them way up.So I received these, and did a comparison with the solo 3s to make a decision.The ANC works well, not perfect but definitely allows me to listen at a lower volume compared to the 3s in a pound environment.The build quality is better than the solo 3s, I don’t have a wide head so the headphones are comfortable to me, the cups are a little bigger and higher quality compared to the 3s.The power off by folding takes some getting used to, and when you put them back on, it defaults to ANC on, I’d prefer if it remembers what the last setting was.The transparent setting sounds like the standard solo 3s to me.I spent over a year with the Powerbeats Pros, a week with the Solo 3s, and a day with the Solo Pro, so I’m certain my opinion will change over time.I’d say what has won me over is the H1 chip and the ANC option, which can be turned off to restore it to Solo 3 battery life in quiet settings (2 taps of the small button on the left ear cup)It’s funny that the pros seem to mirror the 3s in regards to controls, takes some getting used to.Bought the solo 3 and pros on sale, probably because AirPod studios are on the way, the price differences are significant but the upgrades over the 3s are worth it to me.People complain about needing to purchase an audio cable separately with the pros, but the 3s didn’t come with one either in the on sale version I bought, and with the quick charge, it’s a moot point. Also, plug in a lightning cable, and you are charging the pros while wearing them.Like others say, the soft case is kinda BS, that could definitely be improved.I know Beats aren’t the audiophiles choice, but they sound good to me.Give em a try, and if it doesn’t workout, return em!That’s all I got!

R350D4JGK8LA4W,B07YVYNM3N,"3.0 out of 5 stars If you’re allergic to mold, DO NOT BUY! They smell AWFUL cause major reaction",Jack,3,"The initial opening of the package was great. The presentation was great from the box to the case. It was a similar to the thrill of opening a new iPhone box....except not as fulfilling. Because once you open the box you start to smell mildew and once you open the case it smells even more of mildew. The folded headphones. Well, I never owned beats before nor have I had headphones like these that folded so I definitely appreciated the convenience of that. As soon as I took them out, just about every new electronic device out of the package has SOME battery charge, at least enough to connect and test it out. This was completely dead. On top of that after unfolding the headphones, one side had a major dent in the cushion where the other was perfect, which was disappointing, but not the end of the world. I did connect them and the sound quality is pretty impressive. However, I’m highly sensitive to mold so as I unwrapped and tried to test this out I broke into a rash and started itching and now my ears itch like crazy. Benadryl here I come. For $200 headphones there is no excuse for them to smell like mold. Keep in mind the box didn’t smell like mold only the interior of the case and more so the headphones. So I don’t know what that’s about. If they didn’t come with a crushed ear cushion and smell really moldy I’d 100% recommend these. Im a pretty petit woman and I have small ears so the issue of comfort of it sitting on the ears doesn’t seem like it would be an issue for me, but I could definitely see it being an issue for someone with bigger ears or it would’ve been an issue when I had a lot more piercings. I want to love these so much and if they weren’t causing an allergic reaction I’d be totally satisfied, but there’s no excuse considering the price.","Reviewed in the United States June 10, 2021",AGTMIGCZMY6BJJMBSUGIISDQEVTQ,True,3,Color: Gray
R2AUJ6724UWFWJ,B07YVYNM3N,4.0 out of 5 stars Perfect Headphones For Any Occasion,Henry Watson,4,"These headphones are very good at everything from sound quality to the noise cancellation. On my smaller head it fits perfectly with little to none adjustment needed. Even on long rides from 2-3 hours they are still comfortable for on-ear headphones. They are not to big nor small and are perfect for short travel or long distance too. The noise cancellation is way better than I thought it blocks out almost all the noise with no leakage and with music I can’t hear a sound. The battery is perfect only needing a hour charge a week if you use them constantly. The only reason I gave 4 stars is because of the quality of the headphones, they do feel a bit flimsy, at least on my pair that I received. The length adjustment on the left side is very smooth and nice. Although on the right side it is very, very difficult to move it with ease. It is very jerky and feels fragile when moving it. Even though this doesn’t effect me much it is something to note. My overall option about this product is good. It is a perfect headphone for a cheaper alternative to over-ear headphones with the same features.","Reviewed in the United States August 27, 2020",AEAUACLHE2QIFTWHDEYBIBJVX4XQ,True,1,Color: Black

They're very comfortable, the battery lasts a long time, and they charge extremely fast. But I wear them to study for hours in a row and they start to hurt my ears. I estimate two hours of use and then they start to hurt. Also, the arch that connects the ear pieces is very padded, but the top of my head hurts after a while as well. I wear a hat and that minority counteracts it.Other than having to take a break for that reason, they're great.They turn off when you fold them up and they signal that they need charging by a red light under one the ear pieces.

I enjoy the music as I like having the bass more profound in the songs. I used them mostly for watching videos while I was doing other stuff and I really enjoyed them for doing this. I have only had these headphones for around a month. Unfortunately the first pair I had began running static through the left earpiece. That pair also just kind of just shut down on me. They were open and the light indicated that they were on, but they weren't connecting to any of my devices, which they connected well with before this issue. I had Beats customer service tell me how to factory rest them and they began to work again, but then the static in the left ear piece came back. This is when I decided to contact amazon and they gave me a new pair. I received the new headphones today. Tried to make them work and guess what, only connects to one of the two devices I was originally able to connect it to just fine. If I factory reset the new pair of headphones, they would connect to the other device and not the device I just had it connected to. As the title says, I don't know if it's just my luck, or these pair of headphones actually have some serious issues. Looks like I'm gonna need to set up an appointment at an apple store or a best buy to see what the problem is with the second pair of headphones I received from Amazon.

Switch to contacts.- Small ear muffs that don’t ‘cup’ around the ears, they just intensely press them down.-No OFF button, you have to fold them in order to turn them off. Which means you CANT carry them while they are not in use around your head, neck or set them on the table momentarily without it draining battery.

Go to use them the next day after being fully charged, and boom they went dead because they never fully turned off.For $300 headphones, I am highly disappointed.

For the ridiculous price of these you can find something that is over the ear and just an overall better headphone.","Reviewed in the United States June 12, 2021",AFVYDN5M5DXZCHCQWBAM4CSG6C6A,True,0,Color: Black

RNZK5W7YVKGFW,B0756CYWWD,5.0 out of 5 stars Masterpieces: A comparison between Sony WH1000MX3 and Bose QuietComfort 35 II,Dr. Fishopolis,5,"Around the holidays, I decided to treat myself to a pair of high quality headphones. I live in the central area of a major US city, and to be frank the noise pollution was driving me a little crazy. I was interested in a pair of headphones that would give me some peace and quiet, so I spent a lot of time looking at ANC (active noise-Cancelling) options and the Sony WH1000MX3 and Bose QuietComfort 35 II were easily the top picks among reviews.However, there were a lot of different opinions about which was better. The split was about 50/50 between the Sony and Bose, so I was pretty torn. Even though they were heavily discounted for the holidays ($280 each), that's a lot of money considering I generally never spend more than $50 for headphones. So I bought them both as an experiment, with the plan to return one after I made a decision.Let me get this out of the way now, because I'm going to get pretty detailed below. Ultimately, I understand why there's such a debate about whether the Sony or Bose is better. They are both fantastic headphones. I loved them so much that I made the probably financially irresponsible decision to keep them both! They were both so good, but better than the other in completely unique ways. For that reason, there was no dealbreaker for me that makes one superior than the other -- It really comes down completely to personal preference and that's why there is so much debate.The TL;DR of this review is that you should buy the Sony if you value sound quality most, and don't plan to wear them for long periods of time (i.e. over 5-6 hours per session). You should buy the Bose if you value comfort the most, and if you're planning to use them for phone calls.If you're interested in a bit more detail, I'll give my opinions on these aspects: ANC, Sound, Comfort, VersatilityANCThe noise-cancelling on both of these is phenomenal. I had assumed Bose would do better at this since it's what they're known for, but I'm surprised to say the Sony's ANC is slightly better. It does a bit better blocking out non-drone sounds (i.e. people talking, sharp noises, etc) compared to the Bose. With that said, they both are practically equal and I don't think the Sony ANC is so much better than the Bose that it would justify buying them on that factor alone. When wearing either pair, I sometimes feel like a spaceman walking around my apartment because everything is so quiet.SOUNDThis is a clear winner for Sony. No questions asked, the sound is clearer, crisper, and deeper. This is especially noticeable when watching movies/TV shows or playing video games. With the Sony, I feel like I can hear each individual sound clearly, whereas with the Bose everything is a little more muddled together. With that being said, the Bose sound is perfectly acceptable and even 'good'. It's just that for a $300 pair of headphones I'd expect a more premium quality where I am amazed at how clear the sound is. The Sony does that; the Bose are a tier below.COMFORTHands down, the Bose are better. I can literally wear them for 14 hours and they don't bother me except for needing to give my ears a little air every once in a while. I have never, ever worn a pair of headphones this comfortable before. I'm especially grateful for this comfort now that I'm working from home all day because of COVID-19. The Sony headphones are a bit heavier and clamp on your head a little bit more tightly. They also press down on your ears, whereas the Bose are deep enough that my ears don't even touch the inside of the cans. The Sony are still definitely comfortable, but a tier below the Bose. I can still wear them for about 6 hours before they bother me, so if you don't wear headphones that long it might not be a problem for you.VERSATILITYThis is just a catch-all for all the other aspects of the headphones. Nothing here I would consider a selling point strong enough for most people to make a final decision, but if you have specific needs then this might be helpful.1. I like the physical buttons on the Bose more than the touch buttons on the Sony. They just work better, and I make mistakes with them less often.2. Sony has better technology. They use USB-C so the headphones charge faster than the Bose mini-hdmi. They also have better bluetooth connection technology, which lets a higher bitrate of audio transfer wirelessly. Without getting too technical, I think this is a major reason why the sound quality on the Sony is better.3. Bose is better if you want to connect to multiple devices. Bose can connect to two devices simultaneously, but Sony can connect to only 1 device at a time. For example, if I am listening to music on my computer and I get a phone call, if I'm wearing the Bose, I can answer and talk on the call through my headset, and when I hang up music will resume. With the Sony, I'd either have to disconnect from my computer, then reconnect to my phone before the call ended, or take off the headphones completely and answer the phone separately.4. Sony looks a little more stylish and futuristic. The Bose look like an ordinary pair of headphones. Build quality is identical thoughCONCLUSION5 months after buying these, do I regret keeping them both? NO! They are absolutely worth the money if you have it. Generally, I find that I wear the Bose throughout the day as I'm working from home. They're really comfortable to wear all day long, if I get a call from a co-worker I don't need to take them off, and I'm just listening to music as background noise while I work so sound quality isn't important. After dinner, it's always the Sony. When I'm focusing on a new album, watching a movie, or playing a video game, I really value how good the sound is. And generally I only wear them for 3-4 hours at this point so discomfort is never an issue.If you twist my arm about it and made me pick only one pair to own the rest of my life? I'd probably take the Bose just because I wear them so much while working from home. But that's not a fair metric, and each individual will have a different primary purpose for these and that should be your guiding principal when making the choice.Good luck!

R1YF5NA0KL9CK2,B0756CYWWD,5.0 out of 5 stars Solid purchase,Amazon Customer,5,"Disclaimer: I'm no audio technician, just a guy who likes watching movies and listening to music, so take my description of the sound however you'd like.Comfort: These are way more comfortable than I anticipated them being. I have very narrow ear canals, so even the smallest in-ear headphones make my ears hurt after about 45 minutes. I travel a lot, so I need more than 45 minutes of comfort. So far, the longest I've worn these is just shy of 8 hours, and my ears felt fine once I took them off. I have fairly large ears, and the pads don't sit on my ears at all, and even the spots that make contact during wear don't get irritated. The band does leave an impression on the top of my head (I keep my head shaved/close to shaved), but that must be inevitable because I don't notice the weight of these on my head. All-in-all, these are SUPER comfortable, and I'd be surprised if you weren't pleased with how they feel after extended listening.Features: The app isn't buggy like I expected, since Bose isn't an app company. It worked fine for setup purposes, but I haven't used it since. The action button on the left side is nice, especially because it actually works. I don't use it for Google assistant, but I do use it to adjust the level of ANC, and it works just fine. I personally like the button layout on the right side - very intuitive, easy to find/feel, easy to use. My wife wore these for a bit and disagreed, saying there isn't enough distinction between the buttons and she seemed to hit the wrong ones. I can't tell Bose enough how much I appreciate having clear and concise VOICE PROMPTS for setup/connection/etc. It's so nice being able to keep these on my head while switching between devices, and nice having these tell me I have an incoming phone call. I have them paired with both my iPhone and my Surfacebook 2, and they give me ZERO issues being connected to both devices at all times. When I turn them on, they tell me that they're connected to both devices; when I have a call coming in, it pauses the music on my computer to announce it, and if I ignore the call it starts the music back up. I can't get enough o that considering the fact that my last headphones were very buggy when connected to two active devices. The ANC is phenomenal; even on high, I can hear just enough environmental noise to keep me aware of where people are around me, but it absolutely doesn't interfere with the audio. I keep it on high at all times, so I can't vouch for the efficiency of the low/med settings. The battery life is nice - I've used them for about 12 hours spread over 3 days and the lowest battery level was 60% (which it announces when you turn them on; seriously, can't get enough of audible prompts).Sound: I listen to all sorts of music, with the exception of 80s hairband rock, and everything I've listened to sounds great so far. Enough bass to keep me happy when listening to hip hop/rap, but the vocals shine brightly when listening to everything else (r&b/reggae/country). I've only watched about 10 minutes worth of a movie with them on, so I won't vouch for how they fare in that arena, but I'll update my review after I get more movie time with them under my belt.Accessories: I haven't used the cable because it's 2018 and I'm not a caveman. I'm also no sound expert, and these sound quite nice via Bluetooth, so I don't foresee myself ever using it. The case is nice - it's hard enough that I don't fear for their safety when in my bag, and not big enough that I have to adjust how I pack stuff in my bag.All-in-all, I would consider these perfect for everyone except people who use words like ""lows"" and ""mids"" in headphone reviews. For schmucks like me, the sound is perfect, the comfort is perfect, and they're nice enough to make me forget I paid $350 for headphones.","Reviewed in the United States January 29, 2018",AEU722EYBBOTLJAZ6IXVQG2J5W2Q,True,8,Color: Black
RHMM5DJWTVQQJ,B0756CYWWD,5.0 out of 5 stars Tough Choice Between The Bose QC 35 and the Sony 1000XM2,Orangeman,5,"After doing a lot of research, it ultimately came down to the Bose QC 35 and Sony 1000XM2. I tried them both for several days but in the end, the Bose QC 35 was my choice, which wasn't an easy one to make. You can't go wrong with either pair as they are both very nice headphones. The final decision for me was whether I wanted a little better quality (Sony) or better fit/comfort (Bose). I chose comfort and the Bose 1000XM2. Here are some other things I noticed...SOUND QUALITY:No question at all, the Sony 1000Xm2 are better sounding headphones. Don't get me wrong, the Bose are still very good. However, I really liked and preferred the bass response of the Sony over the Bose. Bose are the brighter sounding headphones but the biggest difference was how they sound with bass, which Sony does better.FIT / COMFORT:The Bose gets the edge on fit/comfort. They are VERY comfortable and light! The Sony 1000xm2 are fine but they fit a bit more snug than Bose. At first, I actually preferred the Sony fit. However, after having them on for an hour or longer, that's where I noticed the biggest difference... ear fatigue. Much less ear fatigue with the Bose. That all being said, what is more comfortable to me might be less comfortable to you. You just have to try them on, ideally for extended periods of time. I bought these particularly when I fly where I plan to wear them for hours at a time. Even though I prefer the sound quality of the Sony, I just couldn't get over the incredibly comfortable fit of the Bose.BLUETOOTH CONNECTIVITY:Both do a fine job here but the Bose were the more reliable in establishing a connection without having to fiddle around with settings. When comparing the Sony and the Bose, I often went back and forth trying when trying out the headphones. Every time that I went back to the Bose, it was fast and easy. With the Sony pair, I had to go into my Bluetooth settings a few times in order to get a connection. It really wasn't a big deal but the Bose gets the edge here because it is painless and works more reliably.DURABILITY:I won't give either pair the edge here because I only had them for a week BUT do keep in mind that the Sony 1000xm1 had issues with the headband cracking. Because Sony hasn't clearly stated whether they resolved the issue with the xm2's, it's anyone's guess. This alone probably wouldn't keep me from going with the XM2's but it is something to consider.CONTROLS:I like them both and consider this a toss up. With the Sony pair, you just swipe the headphones to control the music and volume while the Bose has hard buttons. At first, I definitely preferred the hard buttons that are on the Bose. However, after getting used to swiping on the Sony's, I found it easy enough to do. Which do I prefer? Probably the hard buttons because they are a bit more reliable than the swiping. This is very subjective though and I could see some preferring the swiping while others preferring the hard buttons. It just depends on what you like. For me, I found both to work fine. The Sony does have a feature where you can put you hand over the right headphone and it will allow you to hear outside noise without having to take them off. Cool feature? Maybe for some but for me, I didn't see any use for it. If someone approaches me while wearing big headphones like these, I'm going to take them off my head rather than keeping them on with my hand cupping the right headphone. It just seems a bit rude not to do so.FEATURES:They both have their pluses and minuses here. It really depends on what is most important to you. I really like how the Sony 1000XM2 allows you to customize the sound (including equalizer). It also has the ability to modify you settings depending on where you are listening to them by simply pressing a button. I don't really no what impact that has though because I only tried this a couple of times. The fact of the matter is that Sony provides a bit more customization which I like! The Bose has google assistant which I found to be a cool feature. I could live without this but it is a nice feature. The feature that I found VERY useful on the Bose is the ability to play text messages through the headphones. I was on a flight recently where we were waiting for our turn to take off. While listening to my music, I was notified that I had a text message. Instead of having to reach for my phone (Sony) the Bose pair allowed me to just push the action button to hear the text. I found this awesome. Sony does not have this feature. What headphones gets the edge? For me, it's another toss up. I really like the customization of the Sony but the Bose are very cool with being able to read my text messages (and google assistant).LOOKS:They both look great! I had the gold/beige Sony's and the silver Bose. I might give a slight edge to Bose as I like the silver look and the Bose logo on each headphone. However, this is very subjective.SUMMARY:This is one of those times where you just can't go wrong with either pair. They both have their pros and cons but in the end, for me, I prefer the Bose QC 35 by a very small margin.","Reviewed in the United States January 10, 2018",AF2W43SKVV3QDOVRXUZACHRWZBWQ,True,104,Color: Silver
R1E9340503V4J,B0756CYWWD,5.0 out of 5 stars Best tool to get rid of someone!,John Wright,5,"I got this as a gift for my ex, but now I have to attend her funeral. I gave it to her and she immediately put it on so she wouldn't have to hear me. Anyways, I left the house. I guess she forgot she was cooking and was too busy ignoring me, but a fire started and she didn't hear the alarms or people screaming at her. 10/10 would buy for an ex again.On a more serious note: I got these because I have really sensitive ears and my brain occasionally switches to ""let's hear everything"" mode. I'll be sitting at my desk working with earbuds in, listening to a podcast or some music and simultaneously 3 conversations around me. It's not very fun, to be completely honest, and I feel terrible eavesdropping.The complaint that people state of the ""cabin"" is somewhat accurate, as is the point that they don't eliminate all noises. There are certain noises that will go through, some voices will be heard somewhat clear, whereas others will be completely nullified. Distance, angle, and more factors, certainly.Anyways, I'll start with the ""bad"":Cabin-like. Imagine you're placed in a glass box. That's how it sounds. If that's hard to imagine, basically everything around you is heard through a wall. If that's hard to imagine, think about Darksight from DnD. You have a 60 foot ""hear radius"". These headphones halve that. You now have a 30 foot ""hear radius"". Ok, I think I'm done beating this horse. The cabin seems to be most noticeable when the ANC is off, at least in my opinion. It also makes me extremely thirsty, which is good because I always forget to hydrate. So this ends up being a plus in my book. (I had to pee 6 times today. That's 5 more than I normally do.)Noise elimination. The first thing I did when I put them on was to click my nails against my desk. I couldn't hear a thing, so I did it harder and harder until it hurt my fingers. I couldn't hear a thing. Tapping my nails on my keyboard, however, made a noticeable sound immediately. It's hard to tell how ""quiet"" or ""loud"" it was, since I didn't really hear anything else (no music) and, again, my ears are very sensitive to sound.The app used to connect the headphones is very straightforward. I can't speak about the android one because my android is currently just an alarm clock because it lags from having notifications. Right away, when you connect it, your phone will start downloading a firmware update. Don't worry, the update won't turn off your headphones, yet. When the download finishes (it takes about an hour of your phone being on the app, I'm not sure if it needs to be the active app, but I left it as such with the screen on because it was going slowly until I did so), then you can update and your headphones will be ""offline"" for about a minute. Yeah, sucks, but whatever. The update gave it audio-share capabilities, which is cool but I don't have friends, so.. I guess it's cool?The app tells you the ANC level, let's you turn off Text to Speech (you hear beeps instead, similar to an Alexa), and controls a few other controls. I didn't use the Google Assistant because I try to be aware of how much noise I make and talking to myself is something I reserve for when I'm in the car. I tried to use the music player, but it currently only connects to two systems, Apple Music and some weird podcast thing. It does integrate into your music player (to access the basic playback functionality), but it doesn't give you fine controls. Not a big deal because swapping apps isn't hard, and swapping tracks is made easy with the headset. There's probably something else the app does but I can't check because the headphones are in my bag and turned off.The only complaint that I have is that the headphones are nice and tight which is great when they're on, but if I put them around my neck they're trying to strangle me. I guess I don't have to worry about them falling off if I do a backflip, but I'm not flexible enough for a backflip and I like to breath... maybe I can use it for erotic asphyxiation?I guess I can complain about how much noise I make because I can't really hear how much noise I make so I'm super paranoid, and I also think I start whispering because I know it's easy to talk loudly or yell when you can't hear yourself. Nobody has complained thus far, but it's only one day in. Actually, that's not true, today there were lots of complaints about the office being quiet. I swear it's not my fault. I just didn't want to butt into everyone's conversations.","Reviewed in the United States June 8, 2018",AFOG3HS4Z7SEXSJLQKB3ESKYXP7A,True,9,Color: Black
R3PJSCS0S35QJ2,B0756CYWWD,5.0 out of 5 stars My Favorite Purchase Of 2020 Still Going Strong In 2022,ScottyLogic,5,"I bought these back in Nov 2020 and have been wearing them to bed almost every night drifting off to sleep watching/listening to youtube on a mounted tablet. I honestly have little or nothing negative to say about them.10/10 Durability-I'm generally pretty careful with my stuff, but I roll around in bed a lot and can't count how many times I've woken up with these things wrapped around my neck in all sorts of orientations. I've woken up sleeping on top of them. Not any sign whatsoever of them breaking down or the material wearing out.9/10 Comfort-It's the namesake of the product and it's no lie if you know how to use 'em. These are the most comfortable pair of headphones I have owned. At first it was painful because the cans, while comfortable, are rather large and press into your head when you're sleeping on your side. The trick is to tighten the headband all the way and turn them upside down so the headband is resting on your chin. This stops them from pressing into your skull when you're sleeping on your side. If I have one nitpick, it's that it SHOULD be possible to shape the cans so that that's not necessary. Very small gripe, though.10/10 Quality of life-Until I put these on, I didn't realize how much ambient noise was in my apartment just from my AC/Heater/appliances etc. I also didn't realize how sensitive to noise I was and how much of a game-changer good noise cancelling is. They charge pretty quickly (as most headsets/headphones do) and the battery life is acceptable. They do charge via Micro USB which makes them feel kind of old because nearly everything I have charges via USB Type C. As a result, you have plug them in just right and that can be somewhat difficult to do in the dark. If I could change anything about these headphones it would probably be that.9/10 Bluetooth Quality- I don't venture far from my connected devices so range hasn't been a problem. These don't get any interference from any other bluetooth devices and I don't think they have ever randomly disconnected or 'skipped' during playback. Any complaint I have would be about the format and not the product itself.Affordability 7/10- These are expensive, but in my experience you get what you pay for. I live alone so I can happily wear these all day and they were worth every penny if just for the noise cancelling. I would absolutely buy a second set and rotate them out when charging, but the price is a little steep for that.?/10 sound quality- I'm not an audiophile so I'm underqualified to go into depth about this. Sound quality is sufficient. I don't currently own any headphones that I would say are better on this front. No complaints here.Overall it's a great product that I would absolutely recommend for daily and nighttime use. I'm surprised they've held up this long with me sleeping/rolling all over them and I would purchase another set in a heartbeat if they did break. I would recommend them for anyone who lives alone. I wish I could wear them all day just for the noise cancelling. It's so much more peaceful!","Reviewed in the United States February 10, 2022",AHAPNXBAT4J5IFZFHFZNOC4DCB7Q,True,4,Color: Black
R2KDGZ1YN49D5P,B0756CYWWD,4.0 out of 5 stars All around really good,BatteryKing,4,"I am updating after a couple of years of use as things have changed with firmware updates to warrant adding the last star to make it 5/5, but then having issues with lack of AptX support and limited control over being connected to two devices. Something up front I think I should say about noise cancelling as there does seem to be a bit of a debate over it, is it does not block out all sounds and it does not muffle sounds equally, but for practical purposes it does do a very good job at noise cancelling striking a good balance of things and being most effective where it is needed the most to make an enjoyable listening experience. At least this is my experience using this on a daily basis in many different environments. I have noticed on airplanes I need to fine tune how the headset rests on my head for best results, but once finding the proper adjustment it is almost like I am in an isolation room. Fantastic.Overall I am seeing this as well worth the money, a big step up over a much older generation of this product line I had been using, and definitely a huge step up over what came with my phone. I bought this right after upgrading my phone, so in the past week have found some issues were not the head phone's fault, but instead default sound settings I have since adjusted. Also been getting more adjusted to the noise cancellation, which is really a great feature of this headset.For some things I really like about this headset:1. I have a huge head and this fits nicely on it; even covers my large ears comfortably. Almost no over the ear headphones do this and I have looked far and wide. My head is just too big for pretty much all except this particular line of headphones / headsets. In the ear headsets irritate my ears after a while, causing my ear canals to swell up. So having something tolerable let alone comfortable to the point that I almost forget they are on is a huge plus. They also fit on my wife's normal sized head just fine, so it covers a wide range of head sizes pretty well.2. The sound quality and frequency range is great. While I would like frequency sliders in their app, the hard coded balance across the range is pretty darn good. Some reviews say there is a different headset that sounds better, but especially after this latest update, I am having trouble finding room for improvement; it sounds excellent across the range, even deep bass. The main limit I hit is a streaming service I use defaulted back to low quality when I upgraded my phone, so deep bass was crushed a bit and overall was not sounding as good as my home computer which has been the same machine for a while now (where I got the quality options set right a while back), but resetting the values and clearing the cache has fixed this issue. Really with noise cancelling mixed in I am hearing a lot more detail that would normally get washed out from background noise and my desire to keep volume levels down in order to preserve my hearing. Have the best of both worlds now.3. In call sound quality is reported to be good across a number of calls now, even from the datacenter floor. Especially considering this does not have a boom mic, that is pretty good. I remember in the past getting a call on the datacenter floor with a lesser headset and nobody could hear anybody. Then again they have been moving servers to the cloud and the remaining servers are running cooler with the reduced heat load on the CRACs and thus their fans have slowed a bit, bit it is still really loud in there, so both parties hearing loud and clear is pretty amazing.4. The battery really does go the distance and I would venture to say the 20 hour rating would be for harsh use cases where my main use case is mellow office building use. I am thinking more like 25 hours in an office. I just love how my newer devices can just go and go on batteries, at least initially where in the past battery life started off too short an then quickly became frustratingly way too short. Starting off with plenty of time I have some room to do some battery life extension tricks like limiting the charge window manually. Now if this was something built into the product like what you can do with a Tesla car, that would be really nice as changing out batteries every two years or so, especially with how devices are built these days is a bit of a PITA and too often goes badly.5. For sound cancellation, I have to say there is something to be said for pretty much all of the ambient noise just going away and it just being dead silent. Seems to weird some people out, but I think it is great. Can still hear people talk and other loud sounds, but I seems to be rather muffled. Also it seems to be good at figuring out what is white noise and clearing that out completely where some other frequencies that are more useful get through better. Also love being able to walk down a busy street and hear my music, especially without having to sacrifice my eardrums in the process, especially as a lot of really loud noise around freeways and such are really muffled down. Found in a noisy data center that if I were to go to the barber, they would work better, but still work quite well with the hair I have, just little bit of bleed through sound from the excess hair around my ears. Pressing the headphones down causes things to get a lot quieter. Plenty good for easy on the ear drum music listening while in the data center. Have used for other things like muffling noisy power tools and having my wife watch her TV next to me and not be distracted by anything at all. Beginning to think this could be the beginnings of a great relationship... Oh wait a sec.My complaints so far are:1. My #1 complaint is removed as it seems to have been fixed with the latest firmware update as I thought would be possible. Star added back. Thanks Bose!2. I have noticed doors around the office that automatically slam shut while this headset muffles the higher frequencies, the lowest frequencies seem amplified and so it is like my head is getting hit with a sound pressure wave. Been thinking about this more and I have been moving in the direction of what this does muffle, it does so well that what it does not effectively muffle seems quite loud as the ears adjust to the greatly reduced sound levels hitting them overall.3. The radio antenna seems to be on the right side only. Being a lefty I like putting my phone on the left side, but that just does not go well. Have to use the right side when going for a walk. People call me a 'giant', so there is a lot of body for the signal to go through, so most people will probably never notice this issue.4. No AptX support. When connected to TV bluetooth, lips are out of sync. The delay is maybe 170ms, so the delay is in the realm of something I can accept. For those who can't stand this kind of issue, then the Sony option is for you.5. Not much control over which source plays when connected to two devices at the same time. If two devices are playing at the same time it will just pick one it seems. Doing things like connected to phone and TV at the same time, well TV will just cut out with the slightest sound from the phone. Would be nice if the headset would mix the two sources or if I could set it to say prefer the TV and only switch to the phone when the TV stops. Also use this with my laptop and see the same deal. It is nice at least I have have a few different devices to connect to. It is just if I really want to get serious with my laptop or desktop computer, I have to use the audio cable for the previous version of this headset for a combination of dedicated sound, low latency sound, and mic support, especially in COVID-19 days where I am on video conferences all the time and the webcam mic is not nearly as good as the mic on this headset at least in terms of eliminating various room scale artifacts that annoy the hell out of people in video conferences. Would be nice if I could do this all from bluetooth, but sadly bluetooth is mainly for system sounds and music, which is still really handy when I am not on a conference call.","Reviewed in the United States October 10, 2018",AHFJQUW36XIMWE3YOWLRS22VR5NQ,True,31,Color: Black
R1DG7T1Y2Z0L82,B0756CYWWD,5.0 out of 5 stars Google assistant is fantastic!,Serene Flow,5,"Update. I increased my review of these headphones. Bearing in mind any product has room for improvements listed below - I have decided to update my feedback. I am quite impressed with these after in depth testing..The noise cancelling is a bit offputting if you only have on one ear, but if you only cover half of both ears, you can comfortably bypass this flaw. The app is too much to fuss with after setup and I wish you could adjust this without the app or through google assistant. Why have one or the other??? I bought these so I didnt have to pick up my phone as much. Google assistant is flawless with the exception that google assistant has room for growth in and of itself. The auto-connect feature is awesome. I can easily throw these on and they prioritize over my Bluetooth connection so I dont have to fiddle with my phone when Im running out the door in the morning except that google has some beef with Pandora and fails to lunch program from the get-go. If Pandora already up, you can hit the play button to resume from pause otherwise they will continue playing your song from your other bluetooth recever if its already playing - Makes for a very smooth transition / no hassle.Sound is spectacular. Im not an audiophile by any means but am quite passionate about music. Namely ultralow bass music. I have 3 x 12 inch subs for my home stereo and easily can rattle things off the walls and piss off my neighbor's if need be. I found these headphones capabable of mimicking most of these frequencies. Its not gonna rattle your bones and provide your muscles with that delighful bass massage like a woofer can, but they will provide an exceptionally good experience. I used these headphones to help tune my system and found that i can hear more of my music with these than I can my home system mainly in the high to mid range sections. (Can hear down to 20hz on a bass test!!! - boom!) The cupped over-ear pads make sure you hear more of your music and maximises the acoustics that are lost in home audio systems due to furniture.Drop a dollar and buy these headphones. You will be more than satified with your investment! I even use these as ear muffs to keep my ears warm in Wisconsin on the cold days. The music keeps your blood pumping and the heaphones keep your ears warm.I find it hard to take these things off! Too much fun....! Old reviewReceived item today! Out of the box.. there was minimal setup. However minimal issues with getting google assistant to synch. Could have better instructions for that part. There was none for this part! Took a few attempts but all is good and well now.They feel sturdy even though they are plastic. Not a fan of how they fold in the case. I might buy a bigger case to avoid the extra wear and tear.The earcups are super soft. Very comfortable! I have a massive head and these fit great! Not too much pressure. Wore at work for 5 hours and not issues.Noise cancelling could be better. For all the ranting and raving, i expected more out of them. Without music, these cancel less noise than a standard earplug with noise cancel on high. With music, they are much better. You can hear yourself talk when on a phone call which is slightly annoying. You can hear other ambient noises too. I put on my jacket and could hear my arm sliding through my sleeve through the headset. For tuning out office noise with music on i would rate the item at 8 out of 10. I dont have any other experience to noise cancelling other than these. It does create a negative pressure on your ears when putting on/taking off similar to ears popping when changing elevations. Very uncomfortable to one ear it with this feature - its all or nothing or wear it partiality over ears.Music-sound is decent. Must have headphones on and music turned up for best experience. Bass is minimal at low volume which is slighly annoying. Turn it up and you'll hear the boom. Can really jam out in these if you dont mind loud music. It is nice to be able to use these hardwired without noise cancelling but music quality does suffer.Must buy a special cord if you want one for work/home since imput to headphones is not 3.5mm standard pluginGoogle Assistant !! YEAH!! the primary reason i bought these! Pretty hefty price to pay but I've been dreaming about this for months! The integration is fantastic! Reads messages, and full google assistant control just like on phone. It is fantastic! If it didnt have this feature Id be impressed but not for this dollar amount. Ill stick to listening to music on my stereo, but these are great for when Im out and about!","Reviewed in the United States October 27, 2017",AGIVU4564FRRXEJTJOXO62SOEFQQ,True,5,Color: Black
RKP9Q9YOAP4BZ,B0756CYWWD,5.0 out of 5 stars The best headphones I have ever owned,Ladbuyer1912,5,"I always wanted a pair of Bose QC headphones; I just never had the opportunity to have a pair until now. I had a pair of the Beats Studio Wireless 2.0, but they fell apart after 3 years. Because of that, I ordered a pair of these, and I eagerly waited as the headphones were delivered. I was able to try them the next day, and I was not disappointed. I know there are a lot of reviews about how these deliver while traveling, listening to all sorts of music, etc. I would like to share a few pros and cons that I have noticed, as well as a few observations that I have noticed that aren't necessary pros or cons.Pros:1. Sound Quality: There is always a fine line for creating sound that is balanced. These are the best headphones I have used for balanced sound. The highs are crisp, not tinny. I can hear the mids quite clearly, and the bass is full without blowing out your eardrums. At first, I thought the bass was not loud at all, but then I figured it was because of the Beast that I owned for years. If I want my eardrums rocked, I would go to the club. There are sounds and details that I haven't heard before on songs that I have known for years, and the Bose headphones bring them out, making the experience feel like new. When I listen to orchestral music, the playback is so lifelike. I feel like I'm in the room with the orchestra.2. Comfort:An issue that I have had with headphones is that I immediately start to sweat under the earcups, and this is an issue that I've had for years (since high school, in fact). However, I keep going back to headphones because, naturally, they sound the best compared to earbuds. Earbuds also aren't comfortable after an hour, especially the Passive Noise Cancellation ones that go in your ear. When I put Bose on, I feel like a cloud is enveloping my ears. My ears still get warm, but the temperature is much more manageable because the headphones aren't weighing down on my ears. The quality of materials is superb (much better than Beats), and because of that, I can wear these for hours.3. ANCBose's Active Noise Cancellation is the best in the market. Hands down. For reference, I would wear these commuting to and from work on the public bus, and during work. My other experiences with ANC have resulted in white noise from the headphones while blocking out 50-75% of sound. The other headphones barely cut out the bus's engine noise and noisy passengers. These Bose have 3 modes of ANC: High, Low, and Off. The High mode cut out 90% of noise. The bus's engine noise is reduced to a vibration, and all I could hear from passengers is a loud laugh, and this is without music going. When the music is playing, I'm in my own world, and I literally have to restrain myself from bopping along. :)Cons:1. Range:I was surprised about the range of these. I have a water cooler at work that is about 15-20 feet away from my desk, and with my other headphones, I could walk to it and to the bathroom without my phone and I wouldn't get any cutoff or delays. I was barely 15 feet away when these started to cut off. I was puzzled. In the end, it's not that big of a deal because I can just take my phone with me.2. Third Party Voice ControlI have noticed that these headphones were optimized for iPhone users, since the play button can be used to talk to Siri. However, in order to use the Google assistant, I would have to use the action button? I find that odd. Do people with Androids have to do the same thing? It just seems that Bose doesn't want to make a version of these headphones optimized for Android users, since there are a lot of them. But what do I know? This is just a first world problem, so again, no big deal. I have figured out that the action button can be changed to control the ANC modes, which is better for me.Those are the only cons I have for now. I may update if needed.In my opinion, these are the best headphones money can buy. I wouldn't spend more than $350 for headphones though. If you need to spend more than that, you can get a speaker system that would sound MUCH better than headphones.","Reviewed in the United States July 10, 2019",AGSLQKICZUYMZIWLW7S3GOONJBKQ,True,2,Color: Black
RM4Z8KFUUPL2P,B0756CYWWD,2.0 out of 5 stars Bose is Riding Their Reputation,Jason Brannock,2,"I left a lengthy review comparing the Jabra Evolve2 85 (E285) vs Bose Quiet Comfort 35 II (QC35II) vs Bose Noise Cancelling 700 (B700) vs Sony WH-1000XM4 (SX4) (in order of when I received them) for the E285. This is a shorter version of that review, mostly focusing on QC35II and E285. This was almost entirely written up during the week I had all four headsets for direct comparisons.Microphone and PlaybackQC35II recordings were consistently louder than the E285. But the E285 did a far better job of removing background noise, as evidenced by my recordings while drumming. Muting can be done with the QC35II but it was much more difficult than just raising/lowering the boom arm of the E285.Audio Output - DISCLAIMER - I'm not an audiophileE285 and SX4 audio sound better than the QC35II but primarily because I can use an equalizer and increase bass (obviously this is the most important factor). Even if the QC35II had better hardware, it’s not as accessible and therefore is a moot point. Win for SX4. Runner up is E285.BrandBose: wanted my location and would ask for it every time I open the app (and wouldn’t allow usage without accepting beyond the standard Bluetooth connection process). These are headphones. You don’t need my location.Jabra: doesn’t require my location. Instead, it lets me know if I desire to give it my location, it will use it to locate my headphones. No, but thank you for giving me an actual choice! Win for Jabra. Runner up is Sony.ANCWhen standing in front of running water, QC35II had slightly better cancellation, but not a noticeable difference without actively concentrating. When playing on a drumpad, the E285 did a noticeably better job than the other headsets. It sounds like the pad is being muffled (which is what I’m looking for), whereas the others don’t quite succeed. During testing of the QC35II, whether ANC was on/off, there was a ceaseless light static (with no audio playing). I thought it quite odd and luckily, it didn’t happen again, but I suppose it could. With the QC35II, when the drum pad was hit, there was a tang sound, like the residual sound from tapping on a pan, as opposed to the muffled thumping the E285 gives. Perhaps with a constant noise the QC35II does a slightly better job filtering, but the E285 does a better job with impact noises (or maybe it’s just higher frequencies).In addition, the hear-through function of the E285 is awesome. With the QC35II ANC off, it sounds like the microphone is picking up sound and then replaying it in the speakers. In contrast, the E285 hear-through, which has adjustable levels, almost makes it sound like you’re not wearing them (tested at maximum hear-through). Win for E285. Runner up is SX4.ConnectivityThe E285 and SX4 have longer ranges than the QC35II. The E285, most of the time, reconnects automatically when coming back into range. QC35II, SX4, and E285 have a 3.5 mm jack. Why doesn’t the B700? Because it sucks.Double-connection to my PC (independent of range): E285 is easier because it’s just plug-and-play, no downloads or “connecting”. The QC35II and SX4 are only Bluetooth, so you have to do the standard “add device”, etc. An added feature of the Jabra is Jabra Direct, a software you can download to better manage your Jabra. It gives you a few more options and is worth using, in this writer’s humble opinion.Response time: the QC35II and B700 have a slightly faster response time when pausing media than the E285. The SX4 is the fastest, though we’re talking minute (not 60 seconds) differences. The E285 is on the cusp of being slow enough to be annoying, but not quite. The E285 and SX4 also have the cool feature of pausing media when the headphones are removed from your skull. Again, the E285 feel lack-luster in comparison because they take approximately 4 M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-I seconds to pause, whereas the SX4 is half that time. For the E285, I’ve noticed the ear detection only works properly when playing music from your phone and not the PC. When using it with the PC, if I remove the headphones, the music will pause as it should. But it doesn’t resume when I put them back on. If I pause the music with the button, then remove the headset, it resumes. Again, cool feature, but needs work, especially when using it with the PC.App connectivity: some issues with E285. Some issues with SX4. Some issues with QC35II (Bose Connect). LOTS of issues with B700 (Bose Music). Unfortunately, apps are prone to some bugs every now and then. I can’t say which of the two (Sony/Jabra) had more, so neither bothered me much. Win for SX4 (better media response time). Runner up is E285.Voice AssistantCouldn’t even get B700 to work. First off, I have to change the “action” button from ANC control to activate voice assistant (so you can’t have both functionalities at the same time). However, once button mapping was adjusted accordingly, I click the button and it says “open your Google Assistant settings”, with no further instructions. I open the Home app, and once again, no further instructions, so I didn’t get it working. I didn’t spend anymore time on it because in contrast, the E285 and SX4 worked exactly as expected. No setup or anything, I just pushed the button and my assistant came up. The caveat for the E285 is you have to pull down the boom arm to use the feature (you can still press the action button with the boom arm up and have the assistant prompt, but because the arm is up, the microphone is off so it’s pointless). Perhaps Bose has better functionality when used with Alexa, but I use Google so I’m not bothering with testing that. Tie between E285 and SX4.I know this is extremely nit-picky, but the Bose assistant’s voice is far more annoying than Jabra or Sony. She sounds like an actual robot as opposed to someone I wouldn't mind meeting.ControlsThe QC35II and E285 have essentially the exact same button layout and functionality. The key difference is the action button on QC35II. It can be EITHER for voice assistant or cycling through ANC. On the other hand, you can access both functionalities on the E285, with the caveat of lowering the boom arm first for the voice assistant. The other difference is placement of the power button. On the QC35II, it’s a lateral switch on the side of the right ear cuff. On the E285, it’s a vertical switch on the bottom of the left ear. I literally don’t have a preference between the two. However, I do have a preference for the other buttons. While in the same place (the action button on the QC35II is in the same place as the ANC cycling button on the E285), the QC35II has a much more noticeable difference between the volume buttons and the play/pause, which I like better. All the buttons are bigger and more defined, plus the volume buttons are slightly raised, making it even easier to know what you’re pressing. On the E285, the buttons take up less surface area and are rather flat.Muting is definitely easier with the E285 because you simply raise or lower the boom mic. Though it also takes a little longer. The QC35II is more annoying because you have to press two buttons at the same time (the volume buttons). Win for SX4 (touchless controls are better). Runner up is E285.Comfort and StyleI prefer the QC35II. Though I’ve been wearing the E285 for a little over an hour and was so comfortable, I had to look to my left to see which headset I wasn’t wearing. So both are very comfortable, but for comparison’s sake, it’s a win for QC35II. Runner up is E285/SX4 (just as comfortable).ExtraThe E285 has the hear-through feature, which I really like because I use ANC only when there are sounds I actively don’t want to listen to, like from mine or my roommate’s drumming, running water, laundry, phone call, or pooping with the fan on. Other than those times, I want some awareness of my surroundings because there’s nothing more frustrating than trying to get the attention of someone with headphones on (especially at work). In addition, the E285 and SX4 have ear detection (discussed previously). The E285 has a great way of handling multiple calls with its huge button on the right cuff. You can switch between two phone calls by putting one on hold and accept/end/reject calls using it. This is RARELY used, but it's cool.IssuesMy biggest issue was trying to connect QC35II with my Google Assistant. Besides that, functionality of the QC35II was pretty much flawless. Speaking of Google Assistant, there’s some variability with functionality with the E285. At the very least, the action button on the arm activates the assistant. But sometimes the input for said assistant is on the phone rather than the arm. Most of the time it works as expected. I think the additional connection to the PC adds complexity that needs to be vetted out for seamless functionality for the E285.Final verdict, best to worst: E285, SX4 (killer - no mute function, worse hear-through), QC35II (killers - older BT connection, worse audio, poor ANC). Literally wouldn't buy B700.UPDATE: It's been several weeks since I returned all but the Jabra Evolve2 85 (I use it 3-10 hours every single day) and my final rating is four stars while the QC35II I gave two. When the E285 works, it's great. But it doesn't work all the time, unfortunately. Even so, the E285 is better in just about every way. Stronger connection, more functionality, better app, better audio, better background noise removal (though the QC35II you could maybe argue is better at ANC, but not during a call). As far as functionally using the QC35II, I would give it three stars. But I give it two because the Bose app REQUIRES your location and that is absolutely ludicrous. It's a pair of headphones. You don't need my location. Note - if muting yourself directly from your headset isn't important to you and you're not typically in a noisy environment during calls, then I would honestly recommend the Sony WH-1000XM4.","Reviewed in the United States February 13, 2021",AGM4GFRMZNI3U2WHNRS734VKMZRA,True,61,Color: Silver

R4M2VJ2FWVJZY,B0756CYWWD,4.0 out of 5 stars Good headphone with multi device connection problem...,Mehmet Yorulmaz,4,"I was in between Sony WH 1000XM2 and Bose QC35 II. After spending hours on watching/reading all the reviews, comparisons, I chose Bose over Sony, although almost all professional reviewers rated Sony higher than Bose. Let me do a quick review and explain why I did so:i) Sound Quality: 8/10. Very ""clean"" sound. Definitely high quality and pleasing. In fact, it can be described as ""calming"". Not very base heavy. But my main use for this headphone is to cut the background noise and listen to a relaxing music while I am working/studying in a cafe. Therefore, keeping my aim in mind, the sound quality is right on target.ii) Noise Cancellation: 8/10. It cuts out most of the outside noises. But, don't expect miracles as some people describe. For example, if somebody talks, you definitely hear them. There is also a slight pressure in my ears due to ANC, but I got used to it pretty quickly.iii) Comfort: 9/10. The best one in the market in terms of comfort. Especially compared to my Plantronics Backbeat Pro. However, after wearing it for an hour or so, my ears still get warm to a level that I have to take off for a while. This was a surprise to me given all the positive reviews regarding the comfort of Bose QC35II.iv) Call Quality 6/10: As mentioned in most of the reviews, Bose pick up external noise during phone calls. It is not to a level to prevent communication. However it certainly disturbs the other party. Compared to my Plantronics, this was not an issue at all on my Plantronics. People could not figure out whether I was using my headphones or not. So, if you are purchasing Bose for all day long phone calls at work, chose another headphones.v) Features: 3/10. We all know that Sony has many more features (touchpad control of songs, adaptive noise cancelling, quick attention mode, etc.) than Bose. To me they are not essential but nice to have. Especially quick attention mode. When somebody talks to me while wearing Bose, I do have to remove it which is a hassle. In my Plantronics, I could have handle those situations without removing headphone. Another important feature is multi-device connection simultaneously. That was one of the reasons why I did not chose Sony. I was hoping to connect to both my laptop and phone at the same time. However this feature is not working as it should. When I connect both my laptop and phone and try to listen to a song on my laptop, it doesn't play smoothly at all. It stops and starts at every 3-5 seconds by itself as if there is a problem with data transfer speed. And after 1-2 mins, my laptop (Dell XPS 13) crashes (it crashed 4 times within 30 mins). And let me tell you this. I have been using my laptop for the last 2 years. And it has not crashed even once until now. It is also up to date; all Windows & Dell driver updates are installed. Long story short, I can't connect Bose to both my laptop and phone as of now. I hope Bose solves this with a firmware update ASAP.Regarding bluetooth connection strength, it is worse than my Plantronics. It disconnects at shorter distances that Plantronics and once it does, it does not automatically reconnects when I get closer to my device which Plantronics always did without any problems.vi) Final Verdict: 7.5/10: Bose is a good headphones with some flaws and major weaknesses. It is far from perfect as many reviewers/users wholeheartedly claim. To be satisfied with your purchase, you need to decide what features in a headphone is most important for you and what will be your main use. If it is the best sound quality or call quality, or if you want the most feature packed cook headset, skip Bose. You will hate it. If you more care the noise cancellation and comfort and then a clean sound, then go for it.I hope this helps...","Reviewed in the United States November 7, 2017",AGUWJVPYTDHH6SM2TPDDX3TJ7U2A,True,2157,Color: Black
R2SVVC2QOHA3YQ,B0756CYWWD,"4.0 out of 5 stars ATTENTION SMULE SINGERS! REALLY, BOSE???",LGFitness,4,"The Bose QC35 II is by far the best pair of headphones I’ve owned...and I have used quite a few...I haven’t owned this long enough to give feedback on battery and interaction w/my Echo Show (Alexa) but I’m hoping those will be good experience.I’m here mostly for those who are considering investing in these great headphones for the purpose of singing in Smule (the Sing app).First of all, I think it’s pretty ridiculous that Bose would include an audio cable/wire without including a MIC audio wire! But since it’s not a big deal and no big investment, this is resolved by purchasing a 3.5mm wire w/mic, right? WRONG!To make matters a bit more frustrating for consumers such as myself, not only Bose made the female input jack in these headphones smaller than 3.5mm but they also make no mention of it in the owner’s manual. To say such thing is super lame on Bose’s part is gross understatement!So...if you are indeed thinking of buying these to use with Smule app, you’ll need to invest in good audio wire with microphone (I invested in Beats mic wire...can be found at Walmart for $20) and had to purchase a 3.5mm female converter with a 2.5mm male plug in order to connect the Beats mic wire to my new QC35 II. Now, what was BOSE thinking? After all, they know about Smule and how the worldwide popular singing app has and is creating plenty market for the audio equipment industry...and Bose didn’t impress me when it comes to making it rather inconvenient to use these Bluetooth headphones work w/wired mics.And no, I haven’t found any headphones with wired mics that supersede the sound quality that my Bose QC35 II headphones render. So it’s something for Bose to improve...and their marketing folks ought to know better than omit important info from consumers. While Bluetooth option is an awesome thing, there remains certain online activities that require wired mics...Smule being one...and trust me, I’ve tried using “state of the art” expensive audio equipment to sing in Smule and even the most advanced of audio equipments (such hand held microphones; stand mics (Yeti), mic filters, digital headphones, etc, etc) render poor audio result compared to using wired mics with a good set of headphones. As far as Smule sing app goes, even cheap earbuds do far better (because it has wired mics!) than expensive audio equipment without wired mic!So either Bose “forgot” that some of us need wired mics w/a 3.5mm male plug, and by the way, that’s SUPER USEFUL for when battery time is shorter than the consumer intends to use these headphones for, or Bose purposely made these nice headphones w/a 2.5mm female input to make us go out and spend more money just to plug into their nice Bluetooth headphones??Whatever the reason, I expected a LOT BETTER from BOSE, especially while paying almost $400 (that price includes extra service protection warranty) for A PAIR OF HEADPHONES that don’t even come with a wired mic and HAVE NO input to connect a 3.5mm audio cable to the headphones! I feel that there’s always some type of sound quality loss when we have to use adaptor connectors so I truly don’t understand why Bose chose to make the QC35 II with a 2.5mm female input in the headset while providing a cable that has no mic in it! Yes, some use these just to listen to music, videos, news, etc. But what if I’m listening to something in my device while wearing these and using the audio wire and my mother or a friend calls me via FaceTime or Facebook messenger or whatever else? I can easily accept the video call but must unplug the headphones, which usually causes an audio problem in the video conference app, because it doesn’t transfer audio, once the audio device first used is disconnected. Something Bose seems to have completely disregarded. Obviously, the focus in these is the Bluetooth capabilities. But I ask Bose this question: why would I buy a wired pair of Bose headphones that cost not a lot less than these while getting less quality sound? So if these work with audio cable, which it does, why not include an audio cable with a mic??? Charge the extra $20 or so dollars for goodness sake but it’s pretty sad to make such great quality headphones without sending it with a wired mic while knowing that the microphones in our devices don’t handle all recordings and are not designed to work well with singing apps! Headphones aren’t just for listening! What do professional singers wear when recording their songs inside a studio?? HEADPHONES! Is it important for them to hear their own voices through the headphones they wear? You bet! This is why those headphones are well connected with whatever microphones professional singers and studios use. The same is true for ordinary, amateur singers such as myself. But unlike pro singers, all we ordinary singers need is a wired mic that connects directly to the fancy expensive Bose headphones we invest on!It’s a BOSE so yes, they are awesome headphones. But needless to say I’m rather disappointed. I can’t use these until the extra pieces arrive and worse than that, I had to find out the hard way! Nothing in the specs here or even in the Bose website or in the owner’s manual shows that these headphones have a 2.5mm female input to the audio cable. I feel a wired mic w/the appropriate size plug should be something to expect in a pair of headphones that cost $350!!!! Most of all, I feel that any type of electronic should come with pictures of it indicating the physical parts inside and outside of it.Bose mentions that they include the 3.5mm audio cable. Unfortunately, they make NO mention that the end of the audio cable which plugs into the headphones is actually size 2.5mm!REALLY, BOSE?? A $20 mic wire with the correct size male plug to fit into the headset unconventional female input size would’ve saved a lot of frustration here...not to count given you a perfect “5 stars” score...","Reviewed in the United States March 7, 2019",AGMEMZUDUVFBL4OPCZIBJ37QCOZA,True,8,Color: Silver
R5YOX1TJMXBLU,B0756CYWWD,5.0 out of 5 stars Great! Still perfect since 2021. Bought in 2021 for $199 though.,Anastasia,5,"Bought these in 2021 for $199.They are great and long lasting.I use them for eight plus hours a day and haven't had any issues with them at all. The charging time is still fast, and the use after charge has not altered since day one. The over-the-ear cushions and the material covering them, is still in great shape.I do not wipe them with any products either. I keep them on my desk when not in use. They never leave my office so that might contribute to how their functionality is still like new.No environmental particles, temp fluctuation, humidity levels, or kids messing them up.The noise cancelling isn't as great as I personally think it should be. But I'm used to earbud noise cancelling which basically pairs with the noise that is naturally cancelled when plugging it in your ears.So at $199 these are totally worth it. At $250 -275 they would be totally worth it.$330 though is quite a lot.

R1B1C87RU40CSD,B0756CYWWD,4.0 out of 5 stars Lasted 2 years and a week,ufodriver,4,"Best headphones I ever had at any price, and yes I have paid considerably more for a set. Used daily without any issues for exactly 2 years and one week, when suddenly the left side went dead. Looking for a repair shop to solder the wires or whatever. I used the Amazon - contact seller form, but never got a response on email or phone. On that note I replaced them with a $40 headphone from Tozo, also on Amazon. They lack the vocal battery level feedback. And the charging light is near impossible to see. The noise canceling isn’t as strong, but it’s good enough and doesn’t over pressure the eardrums! The phone call sound clarity is better than the Bose for myself and the person on the other end. When talking to my family they all expressed being impressed by the difference.","Reviewed in the United States June 1, 2024",AEZ3PGQSG2IMGXS4QVQQNLWMIMBA,True,0,Color: Black

R3NX26O65C6YH5,B0756CYWWD,"5.0 out of 5 stars Tried Sony + Bose, like this the most",lindros,5,"So I've now owned maybe *too many* of these noise cancelling headphones. I had the very old Bose QC2's (which had many flaws), but most recently, purchased both the Sony WH-1000XM3 (full around-ear headphones) and WF-1000XM3 (in-ear/on-ear). Why the model numbers are so similar I don't know.In summary - I understand why folks love the Sony's - and I've listened to the new XM4's - but even with a high value proposition, I like the Bose a lot better.Here's why I'm keeping the Bose:1. Comfort - my ears became hot/sweaty with the Sony's. I don't know why - the soft pleather ear cup material seemed virtually identical to the Bose. The Bose are more (temperature) comfortable - for both me and my kids. Sony also shows more ear grease than the Bose on the pads.2. True multi-device connectivity - the Bose *truly* can stay connected to two devices at once. It was frustrating having to fully reset the Sony every time I wanted change devices (Mac, iPad, iPhone, LG TV, Amazon Fire Tablet, whatever). Bose figured out how to stay connected to two devices, and easily disconnect/reconnect the other ones paired with the device.3. Sound stage - the Bose has much ""fuller"" sound to me - especially lower frequency (bass) without blowing out the midrange. Professional tests have shown that higher treble is better on Sony, but software (especially Apple Sound Check for some reason) corrects for this - it cuts the bass that distorts the upper-midrange, higher-pitch instruments and vocals. And I find vocals and spoken word to be clearer, if that makes sense.4. PHYSICAL CONTROLS - help me God with the touch controls on the Sony. It literally drove me nuts. I had to learn sideways sign language to control the Sony's. Physical controls just WORK, even if I don't use them often (also note - there are no stupid BEEPS when you turn volume up/down)5. Cost - depending on your situation, $80-100 (at the time of purchase) could be a rounding error, or significant. Amortized over years, it doesn't matter. But it kind of does factoring in all the other things. In my case, I got the QC35 ii -and- AirPods Pro (which are excellent in their own regard) for less than the Bose 700 (and almost less than the full-price XM4).To be fair, these are superior on the Sony headphones (both XM3 and XM4):1. Accessories and boxing - Bose cheapened out. Sony kept it real. Sony has a better fold-up mechanism and better instructions.2. USB-C - this could be a long-term issue on the Bose (USB-A sucks)3. Noise cancellation is superior on the Sony (see #5 above). On the Bose, it's more like ""noise reduction but not really cancellation"". Bose has lost something here - it's clearly Sony > Bose > AirPods Pro.4. Bluetooth version & range - not sure if it version-related, but Sony is superior in both (xm3 is 4.2 vs qc35 is 4.1 - xm4 is BT 5.0). Honestly the range blows me away either way - I can walk around my house.5. Sony build/headphone case feels more ""substantial""6. Bose has sharp edges/parts at the ear cup rotation spot7. Sony was more comfortable to fall asleep in - due to noise cancellation but also the Bose have a ""whoosh"" when you compress the ear cup.And things I could care less about (from other reviews)1. Airplane adapter - if I need to listen to headphones on an airplane that doesn't have a 1/8"" adapter, I'm flying business class. Mine will stay stowed.2. App quality/comparison - I try to avoid (or minimize) vendor apps. These are nonsense (and kept me away from the Bose 700)","Reviewed in the United States November 1, 2020",AEJFDUZF4MTQ7DCU3EPWVS3PUCWA,True,16,Color: Black
R9G09R30OWN3W,B0756CYWWD,5.0 out of 5 stars Can even noise-cancel-out a chatty Marketing Department!!!,John Sweazen,5,"These are amazing and Bose is great! I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities. I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted. I don't even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department. I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients. The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well. Battery life is extremely good. I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset. It comes with an 1/8"" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead. An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time. This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device. It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn't function. Bose support was difficult to deal with. At first the support technician didn't think there was anything wrong with the headset. After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer. This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks. The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall. I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there. After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set. No other questions asked. He just said ""We like to take care of our customers"". I wish customer support would have been as easy to deal with... but, things worked out.","Reviewed in the United States January 24, 2018",AFGI6RQMDSPL62YQ3T7R327Z5RYA,True,1969,Color: Black
R12B4RLO57VG6Z,B0756CYWWD,5.0 out of 5 stars THESE HEADPHONES SAVED MY MARRIAGE,MistressOfTheCastle,5,"Ok, I’m a HUGE Bose fan in general, but these noise canceling headphones quickly became the one thing I would never be able to live without. Don’t judge, you haven’t experienced my husband’s sleep apnea and resulting snoring (Oh. My. GOD). If I was going to a deserted island (and my husband was joining me), the one thing I couldn’t live without out while on my relaxing island getaway would be these headphones. I literally cannot sleep without them due to my husband’s snoring. I tried countless other earplugs and noise canceling buds and headphones (sometimes wearing silicone earplugs WITH headphones to no avail… I tried everything), but none of them worked; they didn’t cancel noise effectively and/or they were just stupid uncomfortable, like so uncomfortable I ended up throwing them out of my bed. I sleep in these every single night, falling asleep to the sound of raindrops. I literally cannot hear my husband come to bed or my five dogs barking when I’m wearing these. They are surprisingly comfortable to wear sleeping on my side, and they adjust to whatever position my head is in, and I almost always sleep on my side which should be uncomfortable.The noise cancellation on these is AMAZING. You can set it high (total cancellation for sleeping or escaping your family or the fact that you work out of your house and CAN’T LEAVE or whatever - almost always my go to… *see Pitbulls and their early morning needs), low cancellation (to turn on at 4am every morning to ensure you hear your blind Pitbulls when they need to go for their walk bc they do not mess around, and wait is not in their vernacular) and off (something I never employ bc what’s the point? - the Bose quality sound combined with all background noise eclipsed is PHENOMENAL). Even if you don’t have a snoring spouse or needy blind Pitbulls or a crazy family (and if that’s you, I’ve got some serious envy), these are the best sound quality headphones I’ve ever owned.The only thing I don’t like about them, and it just started happening and only sometimes, is I get really bad feedback if I lie the wrong way on one of the headphones while sleeping. Frankly I’m surprised there isn’t a LOT more feedback and other issues considering I SLEEP IN THESE EVERY SINGLE NIGHT, but… they’re BOSE, and EVERYTHING Bose I have ever purchased over the last several decades has been superior in sound, customer service (tho I literally have never needed them bc it’s Bose!) and quality. I won’t buy anything BUT Bose anymore. You know what you get, and it’s kickass. Every single time.I seriously cannot recommend these any higher to anyone looking for comfortable, noise canceling headphones. We already all know that the sound quality is unparalleled - they’re Bose, after all - but the fact that I have finally found something that actually cancels the apocalyptic noise my beloved husband makes when snoring makes these invaluable. Side note: I’ve had these for ~24 mos now, I wear them every single night, and they are just as reliable and comfortable as the first day I wore them.What are y’all waiting for? Go get some!","Reviewed in the United States April 24, 2021",AFYWX4R5H4RVUP5EBVEUCFOXXYAQ,True,7,Color: Black

R26M6FAYXGPBDB,B0756CYWWD,"5.0 out of 5 stars Recommend without reservation, with notes re tinnitus",rob,5,"No brand comparison, only compared against $350. I read a lot of these reviews, and also own and like other Bose gear.Sound. A recurring theme in these reviews is that the sound isn't bassy enough or rich enough or something. Actually this was an encouragement to me, because I was just hoping for minimal color, and certainly no enhancement of bass (more on this below), just to hear what's there - in a wide range of styles of music. I love the sound of these headphones, or lack of personality; the music sounds amazing, and as others have pointed out, you really do hear new detail in old music. For example, the old hit Sultans of Swing sounded extraordinary; you know Mark Knopfler's lead would be gorgeous, but also a perfectly rendered P-bass and kick. Similarly dipping back into early Police and enjoy amazing detail in the bass tone and bass/drums balance. Too bassy in the EQ and you lose the insight into normal bass. This also improves listening to classical and work music e.g. Tycho, Mercury Project, etc.Comfort. Very good. I fatigued after a couple of hours of wearing. My not-small ear fits in the cup but seems to be very slightly touching some of the hard irregularly shaped structures inside. I extended wear-time by making occasional headband adjustments. The cushions and construction and button layout all seem fine.Connectivity. So far it works fine, pairing easily without some of the inexplicable Bluetooth wrestling matches I've had with gear over the years. I've got it on an Android phone and a couple of Mac desktops. I was listening to my work desktop and a call came in on the Android, and the ""right thing happened"". I said to the caller ""uh, can you hear me OK"" and person said ""uh, yeah fine"". I don't think this will replace my main conference headset. But it works well enough so far. The voice prompts are helpful. I have not tried the included 3.5 <-> 2.5mm phone cable, but I'd expect it to work in the unlikely event (low battery) I'd want to wire up. Range seems OK; I don't expect it to work if I wander far away from my desktop, and the mobile is in my pocket, so a non-issue there for me. Note on the Mac: turn off the headphones as sound input (mic) if not needed; it changes the sound of the music output.Noise cancellation. Works really well - just what I wanted. Having tinnitus, I was looking to lower the volume of my headphones to save what's left of my hearing and still have good listening. Noise cancellation is a big help here. In fact, the moment I put on the headphones with NC but no source, it was so quiet, I immediately went fuh, my tinnitus is loud! Some of you will surely know what I'm talking about. So, with NC you will notice yourself more, but it's still a matter of letting your mind's other focus put the ringing aside. And try turning down the headphones, about equal to your ringing as a starting point. I wish I had gotten these headphones a while ago! And yes, the seemingly flat EQ is a great starting point for listeners with tinnitus, as boomy bass, even if it momentarily ""drowns out"" ringing, makes it worse over the course of a listening session, and of course over the long term. Save what you have left.Other stuff. Comes with a nice case. The battery life seems OK but very early days on that. Noise cancellation mean you will probably not react to peripheral sound (e.g. spouse talking in next or even same room), and could possibly expose you to new risks such as missed alerts/alarms and people assuming incorrectly that you're aware of certain actions. So use thoughtfully.Complete recommendation, no deductions even considering high price. 5 stars.","Reviewed in the United States March 16, 2018",AGSA5WSS4EH6MPXYSAFWHT5PFOPA,True,1,Color: Black
R3K05DV9VAMA0P,B0756CYWWD,4.0 out of 5 stars A review and a comparison,Randy Marathon,4,"I purchased noise canceling headphones to help dampen distracting noise while working from home. I did not intend to use them for phone calls, and indeed I have not ever tried to do so, so my review does not cover that feature. I tried the Bose QuietComfort 45, the Sony WH-1000XM4, and the Bose QuietComfort 35 II. I kept the QC 35IIs.NOISE CANCELINGThe QC 45 and Sony headphones do a much better job of canceling noise than does the QC 35II. If maximum noise cancelation is your foremost consideration above all else, get the QC 45s or Sonys. Their NC capabilities are comparable.SOUND QUALITYAs others have noted, the QC 45s emphasize higher frequencies. The WH-1000XM4s emphasize lower frequencies but the sound is what I call muddy: It’s not that bass sounds better, it’s that all low frequencies are boosted into a murky mess. The QC 45s and Sonys are distractingly bad in sound quality. This is where the QC 35IIs shine, and why I selected them over the others. Music, across all frequencies, sounds very good. No frequency range is dominant, and I can actually hear individual instruments and voices. I don’t drink NA beer, I don’t drink decaffeinated coffee, and I don’t listen to music through crappy headphones. Although the NC of the QC 35IIs can’t hold a candle to the others, had I selected one of the others, I would have cursed myself every time I used them. The music quality of the QC 35IIs is that much better than the other two. And I know that sound quality can be objective and can depend on the individual user. FWIW, my evaluation occurred shortly after I began my seventh decade on this Earth. BTW, when using the audio cable with the QC 35IIs, I found the sound quality noticeably better with the NC shut off.CONTROLSBoth QC models have physical buttons for volume and pause/un-pause, while the Sonys use various swipes on the right ear cover. As others have noted, each volume swipe on the Sonys adjusts the volume in a very small increment. It is annoying to have to swipe swipe swipe to make a volume adjustment, and that’s when the headphone actually recognizes it as a volume swipe. Double-tapping the Sonys to pause/un-pause works well, and is quick because you don’t have to feel around for the pause button like you do on the QCs. But I’ve come to terms with the microseconds I’ll lose over the lifetime of the headphones by having to fumble for the pause button on my QC 35IIs.BATTERY LIFEI didn’t keep the QC 45s and the Sonys long enough to determine battery life. I haven’t done a controlled study of battery life on the QC 35IIs, but based on my average daily usage, it’s got to be at least the 20 hours that are listed on Amazon.CHARGING CABLE CONNECTORThe QC 35IIs have a mini-USB connector, not the newer USB-C, but like the physical buttons, the microseconds I’ll lose by occasionally attempting to insert the charging cable incorrectly is something I’ve learned to accept.I would have given the QC 35IIs five stars if the NC had been better.","Reviewed in the United States March 20, 2022",AHF2BEZYEOCXADHHOVWZGEUCRTIQ,True,4,Color: Black
R1E6GJJMB4U69V,B0756CYWWD,5.0 out of 5 stars Sometimes I Wear These For Days...,HollyB,5,"These really live up to the name quiet comfort! I have the Sony’s that came out this same year that everyone compares these to, and the latest Beats (Solo3).The Bose are by far the most comfortable out of these 3 and really every pair of headphones I’ve ever had. I love them! The noise cancellation is so good, I wear them at night and any time I want to sleep. Shoot, then when I don’t want to take them off but I do want to watch my tablet, I just switch them on and badda boom! They have great sound. They’re Bose so you know you’re not going to be getting great bass but they’re still well worth the money. Now on sound out of the three, Sony blows everybody out of the water. The sound is so dynamic!!! Every night all I did was jam out to music. I haven’t gone so hard since middle or high school! I’m 36 currently so we’re talking 20+ years! Ugh I miss them. Why? Well they broke at about the year mark. I only found out recently that it’s a known defect in the manufacturing! I thought I was just an idiot. You can have all the sound in the world, but what can you do when they’re broken? They have this great equalizer in the app that adds for entertainment for hours on end. So fun to find the best setting for every song! 😍But as one reviewer said, these headphones do it for you automatically. 🤷🏾‍♀️Best Bass? Do I even need to say? Beats. Come on! That was a no brainer. It’s not just bass, they have great sound. Having said that, they hurt your ears after many hours of use. For me, with my headphones, I often fall asleep listening to music or watching tv. So to wake up with hurting ears at that price point is a letdown. Because there is more bass the sound is a little bit more dynamic than the Bose. Now, Bose has a much smoother sound than everyone else. Kind of giving everything a quieter sound. I have to turn the sound up more. What is an acceptable sound volume for these is blaring when I switch to my Beats.It’s very much a Goldilocks situation when you take all of these things into consideration. The Bose wins hands down as far as noise cancellation. Like I said even without them being turned on they dull out the noise quite well. All in all if you’re looking for above average sound and waaaaaayyyy above avg comfort, the Bose is the ultimate winner. The construction is better than all and that’s really what pushes them in front.I was able to get these on sale on Black Friday and on an installment plan. Seeing as how there’s a newer model and with the discount, I got these for almost $200 less than what they first cost when they came out. This makes for an excellent purchase. These are also rated slightly higher than the newer version, too. So this is a superb set all around. I did all of the work so you don’t have to! You found them!

R1G5FW13S4I8W2,B0756CYWWD,5.0 out of 5 stars The Most Comfortable High End Active Noise Cancelling Headphone Period,Richard N. Barg,5,"There are hundreds of reviews on YouTube about the QC-35s, the Bose 700s, the Sony XM-1000s and other high end headphones. I currently own the QC35 Series II and owned the series I before that. While the Bose 700s and the Sonys have a different feature set, even reviewers who find the 700s and XM-1000s concede that neither is as comfortable to wear vs the QC35s (Listen in particular to the reviews of GYM Caddy). I purchased both the Bose 700s and the XM-1000s and returned them. Both are heavier than the QC-35s and exert more clamping force on the top of the head and on he ears, the former being worse. The claim to fame on the 700s are 6 microphones that do an incredible job of blocking at noise when using the headphones to make callers in noisy environments. The Sony’s are also heavier and while they don’t clamp as much on the top of the head, you always know they are on. The leatherette on the Sony’s are cheaper and the ergonomics and design are such that when you take them off, you notice that a layer of perspiration has formed. I live in the Bay Area. In a very warm climate, this might translate into outright sweating. Many reviewers claim both the ANC and the quality of music sound are superior on the Sony’s. Conceding that, the key attribute of the QC-35s is that you they are so light and well-ventilated that you forget they are on. That can not be said for either the Bose 700s or the Sony XM-1000. You always are aware you have them on. The QC-35s have dedicated hardware buttons for volume up/down and pause. They are great and are intuitive and reliable. Both the Bose 700s and the XM-1000s use a touchpad, which can be error prone and downright annoying to use. It has been well documented that Sony’s touchpad does not work well or fails completely in cold weather. The Bose 700s implementation of volume up/down requires a distinct swipe for one increment of loudness increase or decrease meaning it requires a bunch of swipes. Both the Bose 700s and XM-1000s beep when the volume goes up or down interfering with what you are listening to. It would appear that both Bose and Sony have learned nothing from automobile manufactures who angered customers by removing volume hardware buttons and then had to reverse course (eg Honda Accord) .According to Bose’s own marketing, the ANC on the Bose 700s is at most, a slight improvement over the QC-35s. The music quality and ANC on the QC-35s are good enough. TheIr build quality is better than the Sony’s, which also, inexplicably, cannot pair simultaneously with two devices. The design of the Bose 700s is polarizing. Bose would have been better to add 6 microphones to the QC35s to reduce noise when using them on calls and updating its app and software. If i was transacting business on the phone in noisy coffee shops, I would buy the Bose 700s and keep them alongside my QC-35s for that sole purpose only. In short, if you want a great pair of high end ANC headphones that feel comfortable all the time so much so that you forget you are wearing them go with the QC-35s. Just don’t wear them into the bathtub.","Reviewed in the United States February 9, 2020",AHCZHHNMP4MTYNJLGUE4UHGPLLBA,True,2,Color: Silver

I'm an IT guy, and I work in an office that can be noisy, also due to our friend COVID, I am on a TON of conference calls, all the time. I thought I'd rate all of the headphones that I've purchased recently, and post this review into each of the products so that folks can learn from my experience.In the last year or so, I've purchased and regularly use these 4 sets of over the ear headphones: - Bose QC 35 II - Anker Soundcore Q20 - MPOW H12 - TaoTronics Sound Surge 60Yes, all but the Bose are budget headphones. So how do they compare? I will rate each on according to what is important to me (these 5 things): 1. Comfort 2. Music fidelity (sound quality) 3. Audio call performance (specifically in a noisy environment) 4. Noise cancelling performance 5. Bang for the buck=== BOSE QC 35 ===1. Comfort The Bose are the most comfortable. I can literally wear them as long as I want. (Note: I wear glasses 100% of the time)2. Music fidelity The Bose sound the best.3. Audio calls This is where the Bose take a giant, steaming, smelly dump. Using the Bose for calls in a noisy environment is horrible. The ANC actually reverts to a noise pick up, so you, and everyone on the call can hear EVERYTHING around you. I cannot use these for calls in anything but the most serene environment, and even when I do, I hate the way the ANC turns off. There is a lot on the internet about this, and I would guess that Bose could fix it with a firmware update, but I am afraid they've moved on to the 700 and their future models. I am thoroughly perturbed by how crappy this is.4. NC performance The Bose excel here, and are the best of the bunch.5. Bang for the buck POOR. BY FAR the most expensive set here, and everything is worth it, but the mic/call performance totally kill it for me. Over the last year I've become more and more disappointed in the value of these headphones.=== Anker Soundcore Q20 ===1. Comfort The Anker's are very comfortable, not quite as good as the Bose, but a tie for a close second with the TaoTronics Sound Surge 602. Music fidelity The worst of the bunch. They sound decent, but DEFINITELY not audiophile stuff...3. Audio calls The best of the bunch. Folks can hear me well, I can hear them, and they handle a noisy environment VERY well.4. NC performance Again, the worst. NC works decent, but there is an audible hiss. A plus tho, NC works on calls seamlessly.5. Bang for the buck Good. A decent budget headphone, ESPECIALLY if you make a lot of calls. These are my goto for phone calls in the office. Not as good if you are just listening to music.=== MPOW H12 ===1. Comfort Decent, but are the last of the bunch. They were pinching my glasses arms after a couple of hours, although I've put them on a stand to widen the band and this has gotten much better. Also heavier than the others.2. Music fidelity Very Good. Second to the Bose.3. Audio calls Decent, but the mic picks up more noise than the Ankers, not NEARLY like the Bose though.4. NC performance Great. A close second to the Bose, and at a FRACTION of the cost.5. Bang for the buck AWESOME, due to the great sound/ANC and decent phone call capability.=== Tao Tronics Sound Surge 60 ===1. Comfort Great. Tied with the Ankers as a close second to Bose.2. Music fidelity Good. Very close to the MPOWs3. Audio calls Unknown. I've been on a lot of calls, but at home where it's quiet. This pair has not been in noisy environments. Mic performance has been good in the quiet.4. NC performance Good, but a slight audible hiss. NC works great on calls.5. Bang for the buck Very good. A good sounding headphone with decent call performance and ANC for a budget.

R1YMCOIBYJS7GK,B0756CYWWD,5.0 out of 5 stars Against the Sony MX1000 its a very close race - But QC35 comfort has no equal,Austin,5,"Having tested the Song MX1000x for a long while in Bestbuy and these at the next booth over, it was clear in that moment which I liked better - but i cant help but wonder if the MX1000x had just focused more on comfort what this review would look like instead.Bose is all about comfort, as the name suggests it is built around the policy of supreme comfort, a factor that the MX1000x can't even come close too. Within 30 seconds of wearing the sonys in bestbuy, my ears began to burn and felt the nauseating sensation of a headache growing... and that was only after 30 seconds of listening. Bose on the other hand, even in those few seconds of testing at BestBuy - I could barely tell that I had a pair of headphones on my head.So Bose wins comfort, and i think everyone can agree on this... but that's really about it. Sony has far better noise canceling, you should have seen my face when I pressed the calibration button in BestBuy (and as loud and busy at it was, and i didn't even have music playing) it was dead silent. And dead silent in a way, where even my own excited squeals of laughter were invisible. It was truly like being deaf, unable to hear a thing and nothing was even playing yet. Upon turning on the tunes though, aside form the neddle-like precision of notes, I felt something was missing from them. It was a strange feeling, and I think its the fact that the MX1000x are so good at separating sounds from one another, that music sounds sort of hollow when you really listen to something. It can turn a symphony into a bland practice session, because it's so good at separating notes.QC35 on the other hand, left something to be desired on the noise canceling ability. The loud roar and chatter of bestbuy, became a dull to silent roar, with most sounds around me muffled out. With all music and sounds turned off I would rate the BOSE as more a ""Sound Dampening"" headphone, than a true noise cancelling headphone (at least when compared to the technology of Sony). Still when turning on the music the sound felt full. My face was shocked at the clarity of the notes produced by these headphones. music had feeling with these on, tension, emotion - something I felt the precision of the Sony's sort of took away. The music sounded more like a symphony, than a audiophile picking apart every single note and separating them so you could hear it individually (as the sony's did). This lead me to hear that the BOSE produced better sound to my ears with the test tracks provided. However using truely uncompressed audio, you will be able to hear much more notes and instruments with the MX1000x.Reviewers constantly raved about how the Bass on the MX1000x was much better than the QC35, but to be completely honest I don't really hear that at all. I've ramped up my QC35 against a friends MX1000, and I prefer the Bass tones of my Bose over his, every time (even with uncompressed audio). Even the sound quality of the Bose I sort of prefer, even with the clarity that Sony produces.In the end Bose wins in comfort hands down, there is absolutely no equal in this regard and really the QC35's shining quality. As far as bass and music quality go... its really a toss up on what you prefer. Sony hands down has the best noise cancelling possible, but are extremely uncomfortable and will give you a headache from how close they placed the speakers to your ears so they get squished!If i were placed in the same position again of buying either, I don't think there's any change I would have changed my purchase. However if the MX1000x had been as comfortable, I would own a pair of sony's instead.","Reviewed in the United States December 11, 2017",AEVS3KB2KC3AUQ7JP6QIXN3EXJNQ,True,9,Color: Black
R1EYCQFQ8EV8AL,B0756CYWWD,5.0 out of 5 stars Awesome headphones....thank you Dr. Bose!,SA,5,"To be completely open, I did NOT purchase the Bose QuietComfort 35 II Wireless Bluetooth Headphones from AMZ. one of the rare things. I originally received the Bose QC 35II and later Sony 1000XM3 through a vine program to test and review. I tested both headphones and have used many other types of headphones, over the ear and inner ear.I purchased another Bose QuietComfort QC 35II Wireless Bluetooth Headphone a couple of years later (long story). I am not an Audiophiles by any means but I like Music.! Recently, I read a ""highly rated"" review of the Sony 1000XM3, therefore I felt compelled to write a review of the Bose QuietComfort QC 35II Wireless Bluetooth Headphones.I LOVE the overall comfort of the Bose QC 35II, literally all day comfort. I have worn these when using an elliptical, watching a movie while connected to a laptop, and listening to all kinds of music. Comfort is where the Sony 1000XM3 fell off for me, as did other over the ear headphones. The Sony headphones do sound good, ANC is subjective!The build quality on the Bose is excellent, they don't feel cheap! The bass is not overbearing and heavy, however it does sound clean! Listening to the song ""Purple Rain"", I became immersed in the music...I could hear everything as it was meant. That has not happened with any other headphone or IEM. Sony ear-cups do not feel as solid and I don't think overall quality is the same.I have tried the Sony 1000XM3, Plantronics FIT, Grado Labs SR-80, JBL, Apple OEM inner ear, Klipsch IEM, and a few other generic brands. The Bose QC 35II remain my favorite for sound! The Plantronics are good for working out. The IEMs, such as Klipsch get full of ear-wax.I have the headphones connected to the Echo, so I can push the speech button the headphone and ask Alexa to play a song. That is sweet!! There is also a multi-function button for Siri, which Bose does not advertise. Pairing to phone and laptop was a piece of cake, the headphones tell you which device it is connected to. The Bose App is basic but provides information on the headphones, firmware updates, and connection to Echo.Sound is a personal thing, everyone experiences this differently. Therefore, headphones that work for me, may not work for you. I have used the following types of headphones:Sony Sports Wired (going back to the 80's)Panasonic (going back to the 80's)Grado Labs - SR-80 WiredKlipsch IEM WiredApple OEM wiredPlantronics FIT BluetoothSony 1000XM3 BTBose QC2 BTSony is a conglomerate, multiple business units making different products. We all know that Sony is a legendary company!I Sony products are hit or miss. I have been a little obsessed with Bose, not only the products but as a company. The Bose QC 35II are something that the company's founder - Dr. Amar Bose would have been proud of. Bose as a company is an amazing story and the products that they produce are incredible. I am now thinking about their portable speaker offerings.The only drawback that I can is the lack of an EQ in the app. However, many other manufacturers do not offer this.","Reviewed in the United States November 24, 2019",AGWH6V6CL7I7XZMXOYEJCVOOBKHQ,True,1,Color: Black
R1V5T97I2VLBBW,B0756CYWWD,5.0 out of 5 stars Best headphones I ever owned,David Hofmann,5,"I waited 6 months for this review. I tested this headphone is many different situations. I'm deeply impressed and I'm very satisfied with it.Noise cancellation is excellent. The closed design eliminates a lot of noise already, and the active noise cancellation does a stunning job filtering out even more. Really works well!Connectivity is very simple and works well every time. It automatically connects to the different devices I have. My phone, my tablet and my laptop. Yes it will connect to all three at the same time. For example if I'm working on my laptop I get the sound of my laptop. But it's also connected to my phone. If a call comes in, it goes to my headphones. No switching or disconnecting from the other device.Volume control works on all my devices without having to set anything up. It just works. Pause, skip forward and skip backward. There is also a button for google assist, but I never use it. I assume it starts Siri on an iPhone.When watching a movie or my laptop or tablet or phone, there is no noticeable delay in audio. This was a problem with other bluetooth speakers.The sound quality itself is nothing but stunning. I can hear every single instrument on a song that I wasn't able to differentiate listening on other speakers or headphones. It's hard to describe. Think about it as super high resolution photos. Every little detailed is rendered just crisp and clear. That's how these headphones sound. At the same time the sound is very neutral. This was a little confusing to me at first. All other headphones or speakers I used before seem to push certain frequencies and try to 'enhance' the sound in some way. They boost things but that is not making it sound better, it actually distorts the music from it's original state. This was a little confusing to me at first. To go back to the image analogy. Other devices try to enhance the colors and saturation and crank up the sharpness. It just all effects but they are not making the original image any better. These headphones give you the truest, most neutral sound. This took me a little time to getting used to at first, but now I appreciate to hear the music just the way the artist intended it to be. If you prefer to have your headphones yell at you and 'boost' things, the app will allow you to do that, though. Speaking of the app, the headphones work just fine without any app. Most of the time I use my headphones with my laptop and the phone isn't even connected. I only mention it because other review mention it wouldn't work without the app. That is definitely not true.The only thing I wish for is that the volume would go up a little more. Even when I adjust the volume to max I feel like with some song I would love to have a little more girth. All in all, I'm very happy with these.","Reviewed in the United States November 13, 2020",AE33TNNVOOANCCQPO2L4I3RVTQQA,True,10,Color: Rose Gold
RCTMEB3Z8VY0Z,B0756CYWWD,2.0 out of 5 stars Horrible Range and Everyone Else Can Hear Your Music,Int93,2,"Update(3/6/2021): The noise canceling has now stopped working. I don't know about you, but I'm not made of money. I like to pay a little more upfront for a product that is going to last a really long time. That's how this whole buy nice or buy twice ideology of mine started, was headphones. I got tired of going through cheap headphones that were like $20 and constantly replacing them to the point where I could have just bought a nice pair. I think when these completely die, probably gonna try Sony, seems Bose QC has gone done the pooper before Aunt Rona even came to visit. And then if Sony is good, probably going to just stick with them until something bad happens. And this is how customer loyalty is created and destroyed.Update (2/8/2020): I have reduced my opinion to 2 stars as now I have to constantly turn it off and on. Sometimes the music will start skipping like an old school CD player which can then be fixed by turning it off and on again. This is while sitting right next to my computer also. Also it decides to sometimes just disconnect and reconnect itself telling me the battery level again, upon which I need to sometimes turn it off and on again and listen to her tell me the battery power and who she is connecting to and who she has connected to making a large gap in my music play. Also I take very good care of my devices. Everytime I take it anywhere or am not using it, they go back in their case, so it's not from me doing something stupid.Update: So I have found that there is a way to stream music form your computer to your phone (BUUUTTT for the price, you shouldn't have to do this IMHO). There are lots of options, but I highly reccomend using foobar2000. I think it's the best media player anyways personally. With that feature you can stream it from your computer to your phone and keep your phone in your pocket and travel around the house without any problems. Just down foobar2000 for your computer (free) and foobar UPnP/DLNA Renderer, Server, Control Point component (free) and the foobar2000 app (free). Be sure to check firewall settings. [Note I am using Windows and Android. Not sure if these apps/programs are available for Mac\Iphone].Update: I actually might say that they're 1/4-1/2 the range of the beats. They don't do well at all when ANYTHING gets in between them and the computer. I was laying on the floor about 2-4 feet from the computer with only the desk in between us and I cupped the outside of the headphones with my hands and it cut out all signal. Every time I go around the corner to the kitchen which is probably around 18-24 ft away, just one wall in between, they start skipping and cutting out. With my beats, I can go around the entire house, upstairs, outside and not have a problem with the same set up and location of computer.I owned the Bose QuietComfort 25 II's for a long time. I happened to be gifted a pair of Beats in ear wireless headphones and I fell in love with not having my head yanked by a cord and being able to go anywhere (since my ipod finally died and I have way too much music anyways, I have just been keeping my music on an external hard drive and using Bluetooth. I really need the over ears noise-cancelling for studying though. So I would switch off between yard work with the Beats and studying with the QC's which got old. So I decided to fork out another few hundred for these.Pros:They do sound great, I don't notice any improvement over sound quality from the QC25s though.The battery does last all day (I use them a LOT). It's nice not having to carry around batteries anymore like I used to and have my head yanked all the time.It's nice to have buttons that actually work now. With the QC25s, the play and pause and volume buttons wouldn't work with my computer, but now they do.Cons:The range is horrible. I can go around the corner and it will start getting sketchy on me. Comparing it to the Beats, I'm probably getting 1/2-3/4 the distance and not reliably. I definitely can't do yardwork in my not huge yard with these unless I used my phone that I carried with me. You have to be close to your computer if you're using it as your music source.If you like to listen to loud music, People will be able to hear it. Sometimes I just need to crank up some loud music and focus and drown everything out. Noise cancelling is not really noise cancelling, it's a cancellation of particular frequencies and is more designed to drown out things like an airplane engine (which it does well). But you will still be able to hear all the people around you talking if you have music down to a moderate level. When listening to my loud music, my wife complains that she can hear it from across the room (about 20 ft), and not just a little muffle, but can actually distinguish the music. This means that the people in the library must really have been hating me...Conclusion: If you listen to loud music and study in places like the library, you might want to skip out. If you have QC25's and you don't HATE having your head attached to something, might not be worth the cash. I have no comparison for other noise cancelling headphones, so I can't say if they are the best in the market or not. I do understand the technology and know that there definitely isn't going to be true noise cancellation anytime soon, so you do have to take other factors into consideration. Overall I'm mostly happy, but there is definitely a LOT of room for improvement. I do spend a lot of time in the library though, now that I know that it is that louds outside my headphones, I might have to consider other alternatives.","Reviewed in the United States December 2, 2019",AHPIWW7W7H6FG7ANOKEWKQJ5KJRA,True,7,Color: Black
R67SOLZ6L2RAQ,B0756CYWWD,4.0 out of 5 stars Best set of headphones I've ever owned - ALMOST perfect,futureboy,4,"I love love love love love these headphones. I use them daily, I travel with them, I never leave home without them. I used to be afraid of Bluetooth headphones because of concerns over battery life or headaches I would sometimes get from Bluetooth (true story!). That being said, these QC35s are AMAZING and I am so happy I own them. I used to think the Bose QC20s were the absolute best, but I have since gone cordless and I don't think I can go back.The battery life is solid - I can use these pretty almost all week without recharging them. The sound quality is solid. I'm not an audiophile but it sounds great to me. The noise canceling is fantastic and I can't really imagine flying anymore without these.There is only ONE problem with these and the rest of the Bluetooth Bose headphones: the ability to pair with two devices simultaneously is both awesome and super annoying. I tend to pair between either my MacBook Pro and my iPhone, or my iPhone and my iPad, depending on where I am. The headphones will pair with both, but sometimes the headphones will ""listen"" to one of the devices when I want to hear audio on another, which makes me end up doing some jumble of turning off Bluetooth on one device so I can force the QC35s to listen to the device I want. For example, when I fly now, I try to remember to turn off Bluetooth on my MacBook Pro if I'm not using it and leaving it up in overhead storage, because even when asleep the Bluetooth is still on and the QC35's will pair with them, when I only want to use my iPhone or iPad to watch movies or listen to music. So in these situations, I have to load the app on my iPhone and disconnect the Mac, or pull out my MBP and turn off Bluetooth. Super annoying. Suggestion to Bose: add an extra button that lets users toggle between which Bluetooth device we want to hear. Perhaps even allow a third connection. Then, I could sit there on the plane, paired to my iPhone, iPad and MBP, and I could click a button to toggle between which device I want to hear. Problem solved and I would be super happy. USB-C charging would be great too since this is inevitable for our devices.I'm still giving these 5 stars because despite this Bluetooth issue, they are still my favorite headphones for daily use. So, in summary, I love these, but here are my three suggestions:1) Add a button to toggle between paired devices.2) Increase number of allowed simultaneously paired devices to 3.3) Switch the port to USB-C for charging since this is the future.UPDATED REVIEW: MAY 2020I am sticking with my 4-star review of the QC-35s. I am using them right now, but I am about to put them down in favor of my newer Sony WH1000XM3 headphones which I am liking more nowadays for a few reasons:1) USB-C charging, of course. The new Bose headphones do have USB-C so this isn't fair, but whatever.2) The Sony headphones can only connect to one device at a time, which I like. If Sony finds a way to easily toggle between possible connected devices, allowing the USER to decide which device to pair with rather than which device is playing audio, they will be indestructible.3) I actually find the noise canceling better on the new Sonys.I'm still going to use my Boses for a bit longer until they are no longer usable, but the Sonys have my heart now.","Reviewed in the United States March 6, 2019",AFA6SIRQ7RGQZO2XHNZNRML7SBGQ,True,2,Color: Silver
R2EYDXR1HCZV1D,B0756CYWWD,5.0 out of 5 stars Worth the price. Nice noise reductions.,Andy Lambert,5,"I've had these for about an hour. Very comfortable lying in bed on my pillow. They came 50% charged. I was surprised the volume was lower at maximum than I expected. The base was punchy enough and not muddy or over modulated. I chose Google assistant and it has followed my commands. I was surprised to learn that you need to replace the batteries. I don't know however, how long it will take before they need replacement. There is a usb charging port so maybe they'll last a long time. The instructions say only a qualified Bose tech can replace them or they give you a website to go to. Your choice. UPDATE: A month now. I realized you don't need super loud headphones with these. Because they're so noise canceling I heard nothing but crisp, clear, music.I chose google assistant over Alexa but the choice is yours. I wear glasses so, although much better than the $80.00 on ear non-noise cancelling Sony MDR650BT's I had to buy and throw away twice because they kept breaking. I did find these to burn/hurt my ears after about 4 hours so I occasionally had to take a break. I didnt find them too tight and they didn't sweat at all. Although you have to take the price into consideration because they were a little over $300.00 brand new, (quite expensive). To me, they are worth every cent. They charge quickly and I'm always between 90 and 100% full. She tells you what you have when you turn them on. I found the left ear google assistant button, although large enough, a little clumsy. I could never remember if it was at the top or bottom of the earcup. I'll get used to it eventually. Nice and clear phone conversations on both sides but to use the headphones for phone calls, you need to press a button squeezed between the high and low volume toggles. My Sony's automatically switched between music and phone calls. Didn't need to press any buttons. The music would automatically stop to talk and turn back on, hands free, after the other party hung up. I still find myself reaching for my phone when I hear it ring through the bluetooth headphones when all I have to do is hit the switch on the right ear cup. If you answer the phone manually, you have to talk using the phone although the music playing in your headphones will mute then come back on automatically when you hang up your cellphone. I love these! I'm glad I bit the bullet and paid for better quality, behind the ear, headphones, although Sony and Bose basically sound the same. Just nice and quiet with the Bose. You can also pay by 3 equal installments from Amazon instead of instantly forking over a large one time payment. I also had the Sony's and Bose in my device list at the same time paired. I think I'll keep the Bose as my go-to headphones.","Reviewed in the United States September 8, 2020",AE7V66XUPFPTYTL72JX5FRH3H2NQ,True,1,Color: Black
R2YMX4JKLMOO4Z,B0756CYWWD,1.0 out of 5 stars The Next Best Thing to Disposable Headphones. Junk.,Michael D. Austin,1,"Update 4-26-20: These *brand new* headphones are now failing after 7 weeks in use. Bose just replaced the *2nd new pair* right before a year's time elapsed. This third pair is having frequent sound dropouts (no sound) during Bluetooth music playback on a Windows 10 desktop, and during Bluetooth telephone conversations on an iPhone. My $128 backup pair of Sony NC headphones is not having either of those problems on either the computer or the smartphone I use. This is unacceptable and these headphones are junk. This is the third pair Bose has replaced in a year's time.Update 2-13-20: These headphones *were* my favorite choice based on their combination of comfort and potential reliability for a price of $350 or under. They have frequent-enough sound dropouts (sudden, short absences of sound. More than the $128 Sony NC wireless ear cans I've tried). Bose *just* replaced the 2nd pair of these under warranty, without cost, and inside a year's time. Two pairs broke in their 1st year. Yes, I use them lots but they're never abused. They're very comfortable and the NC is the best I've heard... which *doesn't* mean there aren't better ones around for more money. But these are the ear cans I choose to wear every day to encourage my creativity and sanity ;-)Update 12-17-19: These headphones keep losing their connection with Windows 10. Getting Windows 10 connected to them. Having them stay connected is completely unreliable.Update 11-19-18: I now have new Bose QC 35 II headphones sent under warranty, which replace those purchased seven months ago in February. For a $350 device to be replaced at the manufacturer's cost is a reasonable thing. But a seven-month life for these headphones suggests I'll reserve my further observations about them for later.It took Bose 17 days to replace the first broken pair, which inexplicably quit working without warning, and without abuse. The new headphones work but pairing was at first very fiddly: In order to get the headphones to connect to both a new computer and new-enough smartphone, each of those devices had to be powered off while the other was paired. I made two separate phone calls to Bose tech support to achieve pairing.I use these every day for telephone calls and personal listening. These are still the most comfortable headphones I've found, and the sound fidelity and noise-cancellation are pretty good for what they cost.Now that these headphones are paired with a brand new computer, and with a new-enough iPhone, the headphones are keeping their connection to both devices. And the headphones can play from either one or the other device without undue attention. This is as I'd expect from a product costing $350.Update 11-7-18: Without being abused, these headphones instantly and mysteriously stopped being able to connect to either a new desktop or new smartphone. After telephoning them, Bose told me they'd ship me a brand new pair at no cost, to replace them once they receive my broken ones via their prepaid shipping. This is not a poor deal. Nor is it a great one. Because meanwhile I must use a replacement pair. My temporary replacements won't be Bose, and I'm glad of that.Update 10-13-19: I take very good care of these and use them daily. $350 price / 20 months use at this writing = $19 monthly cost. Yet Bose had to replace the 1st pair at seven months and that interrupted their use for 17 days. You'll need a back-up pair of something if you use them every day.Update 6-24-18: To add to what's below this paragraph, there are currently no more sound drop-outs (silent gaps in phone conversations) as described before. Just recently in noisy environments (like cafes) the people I'm telephoning have observed that they can't hear me on the calls *and* also that there's so much in the background that all they can hear is that noise. This problem seems to be solved by wiring the headset to my iPhone 7 Plus with the Apple Lightning to 3.5 mm adapter cable. I've now been using these QuietComfort 35 Series II headphones periodically for around four months for both audiobooks and music. I find them to be good for $350 but not exceptional. I do enjoy the noise cancelling in public environments because the noise attenuation promotes sanity and focus on audiobooks or music. And these are the most comfortable headphones I've used compared to a $280 Sony pair and two separate Avantree pairs.These Bose QC 35 II headphones continue to be very good for listening to music: They've very good sound fidelity and the noise cancellation is very good. Yet they're quite poor for voice conversations: Their regular sound dropouts which interrupt the conversations, their poor microphone placement, and their frequent issues with device pairing and device selection make them only a back-up choice to my wired earbuds. I've been using them on a two year old iPhone 7, a four year old Windows 8 laptop, and a one year old, fairly high-powered Windows 10 desktop. My long experience with Bose earbuds and headphones which I started in 2013 recently encouraged me to shop for a different manufacturer for home audio. I ended up with Sonos' to play Spotify at home. I've declined using cloud services for voice commands.Older review content below this paragraph. Read that too:Frequent sound drop-outs -- short, two-second periods of silence -- during both music and telephone calls. This requires that I now open a product support case with Bose for headphones which are two months old.They're very comfortable. They paired easily with a 2010 iMac running El Capitan 10.11.6. They sound as all the many reviews I read said they would: not as clear as a few other makes in the same price range like Sony or Sennheiser. Or maybe even other, wired Bose headphones. Yet the better noise cancelling would be an acceptable tradeoff for me for long airline flights. Their receiving range is 25 feet shorter than the Sony H.ear on Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones model MDR100ABN/L, and the Sonys have noticeably better sound fidelity. But I couldn't wear the Sonys for more than 40 minutes without them feeling over-tight and uncomfortable.The noise cancellation on this over-the-ear headphones seems better than my Bose QuietComfort 20i wired earbuds. But those wired earbuds also have much better sound fidelity and I use them all the time for voice conversations: the earbuds have an in-line microphone which works much better and sounds much better than the more distant microphones of Bose QuietComfort 35 Series II wireless headphones. The wired earbuds also don't have sound drop-outs and instead have contiguous sound signal.But, also, where we live in our woods, these Bose QuietComfort 35 Series II headphones have unacceptable, low-level interference from an unknown source via both the 2010 Mac and via my 2017 iPhone 7 Plus. There are low-level, audible voice conversations from others to be heard in the background. In starting my research on this I see that Bluetooth runs on the same frequency as 2.4 GHz. Since the homes where we live are low-density, and we live in a wood, I would now have to investigate a source for the interference on these. But for a product which costs $350 new, that's unacceptable. Time will tell whether I keep them.On an older but still very well-functioning Windows 7 PC I've successfully paired these Bose headphones to a Kokkia Bluetooth transmitter iSplitter. Now testing both of them.","Reviewed in the United States February 10, 2018",AFZXL62ISPVF6PESZ24LU2QMFVKQ,True,12,Color: Silver

Good for traveling and somewhat sturdy. If you’re between this one or the QC 45 SE, I would say get the 45s as the finish is a little better and the pad that goes on top of the head is made of leather.

R19ED6FGBIPAN8,B0756CYWWD,5.0 out of 5 stars Bose hits it out of the Park with these!,DTodd,5,"I was in the market for a new set of premium headphones and I agonized for days over whether I should choose the QC35s, the Sony WH1000XM2s and the Sennheiser P550s. They all had their strong points. I finally broke the logjam by selecting according to what I wanted in a set, versus cool but unnecessary features that I would probably seldom use or need. And as you can probably guess, I ended up selecting the Bose QC35s.I recieved my QC35s within 48 hours or ordering from Amazon. Upon opening the package I was both pleased and underwhelmed with a few features. Let's talk about something good first. The semi-hard case really rocks. -Well-built and padded to keep the QCs relatively safe. However, the provided USB charging cable was ridiculously short. Without measuring, I guess-timate the cord to be a out 8 to 10 inches. The included headphone cable was less short but still a bit underwhelming in length. Bose is a premium company, and for the price of entry to purchase these headphones, there is no reason why they could not include cables that are at least a serviceable length. Without checking, but having owned many Sony and Sennheiser headphones over the course of my lifetime, I'm willing to bet they would not make such a remedial mistake.Fortunately, the QC35s made up for the cable issue with outstanding sound characteristics and excellent noise-cancelling capabilities. The sound stage of these headphones is expansive. I can hear separation between instruments that sounded muddled and undefined in my previously award-winning Plantronics. In fact, I would say that you probably would be hard-pressed to make a pair of headphones that were siginificantly better using a Bluetooth connection. And that's just because you get to a point in sound quality that is really only limited by the Bluetooth standard.As for the claims that I've seen in other reviews that these don't have any bass response, I will tell you that anyone that thinks these headphones don't have bass needs to immediately get their hearing checked. And anyone who needs more bass than these are capable of producing are probably causing themselves some real hearing damage.In terms of sound quality, will these compete with my wired Sennheiser HD 380 pros? No way. Not even close. In fact, any Bluetooth headphones I've ever tried, no matter how much money you throw at them will get stomped by a decent set of wired headphones. And that's just the reality of Bluetooth, until a new technology takes its place.BUT what you're getting here is an excellent portable set of headphones that sound pretty sweet and have excellent noise reduction. I ride the Washington DC Metro (subway) to work every day, and once I set the ANC and turn on the music, I never hear another sound other than the music. They're also reasonably comfortable and actually fit my big ears and head very well too. Bose claims 20 hours of use from a single full charge and I am inclined to believe that figure. I can charge them on Monday, and by week's end, I have ridden the train a combined 15 hours, and have plenty of juice left. If you've owned a decent set of Bluetooth headphones before, these probably won't blow you away, but they certainly won't disappoint either. Bose gets it right here, and I'd wholeheartedly recommend these to anyone looking for premium set of headphones.","Reviewed in the United States April 5, 2018",AHLQP6LTDDC5HOP5TELA473KFRDQ,True,23,Color: Black
R967E9BBVLTVX,B0756CYWWD,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great Audio, Poor Mic",Grym,4,"TLDR: Good audio, great noise cancellation, crappy mic, horrific at connecting to and switching between multiple devices. These are very comfortable headphones, they sit on your ears like clouds. I've had mine for a couple of years now and they have had a lot of use. The audio quality is excellent, as you would expect from a $350 pair of headphones created by Bose. As with other Bose products, the audio quality is designed around a full acoustic range rather than the bass-focused types of headphones. I appreciate that about Bose and the bass is more than adequate for my tastes. The noise cancelling is excellent; it definitely exceeded my expectations. The passive noise cancelling is decent for how comfortable and lightly the headphones sit on the head and ears. The active noise cancelling will shut out all ambient noise in a quiet room, cut sound down by half in a moderately noisy environment, and reduce ambient noise noticeably in loud environments. The active noise cancelling is very effective when coupled with music (not classical) played at a moderate volume. The one major defect in these headphones is the microphone quality, especially when connected to a computer. The microphone is a pinhole type mic that picks up everything around you like a cheap cell phone. The audio quality is scratchy through it due to this defect. When connected to a computer, the headphone firmware does not allow for the computer to recognize the headphones and microphone as separate devices, instead displaying the options to select either only the headphones or the headphones as a hands-free device. This activates the microphone and loops the mic audio into the headphones which distorts the audio quality and degrading it into the same quality you could expect from a cheap pair of Walmart headphones for toddlers. The Bluetooth connectivity is a bit of an issue as well. While you can hook up multiple devices to the headphones, the option to switch between devices is inconsistent and endlessly frustrating. For example, if connected a tablet, computer, and cell phone, they will sometimes allow for switching between devices and sometimes not, and sometimes will require the entire stored list of devices to be deleted from the headphones (by holding the on/off button forward for several seconds) and then reconnected to the desired device. After two years of use, the stitching around the right ear has come undone. It's still usable, but it's getting close to the point that they're going to be annoying to wear. All in all, a decent pair of single-device, Bluetooth headphones with a crappy mic and poor integration into computer use and horrific when connected to multiple devices. If you're looking at these for just audio use and excellent noise cancellation, definitely buy. If you want something with a decent mic, multiple device connectivity, and computer integration (such as Zoom conferences or gaming), keep looking.","Reviewed in the United States September 24, 2020",AGRJDPRLOFPEVH4EVKEXAE3HGTFA,True,5,Color: Black

RHGN2MR82GU3J,B0756CYWWD,5.0 out of 5 stars So far so good. I bought it because I often forget taking ...,Songhai,5,"So far so good.I bought it because I often forget taking earbuds on flights and have to buy them on flights which I quickly loose before my return trip! So I thought maybe carrying a sizeable wireless headphone will solve the problem considering the significant size.Additionally, it helps to watch and listen to TV program at home when others are doing their own thing without me distracting them.Pros:1.Sound quality is good.I like that the equalizer self adjusts to the sound continuously and you do not have to make any manual adjustment. The sound it delivers is undiluted. It is as rich as the sound coming out from our old Phillips surround speakers connected to an OPPO audio/video system.2.The cancellation effect is excellent.At a high level, it effectively cancels out all external ""noises"". For safety reason, I use it on the low level so I can still be aware of my surrounding.3.It is very comfortable on my ears.I do not just place the ear piece over my ears .I deliberately make sure I place it over my ears coming from a back approach.That way the ear lobe sits into the recess and no pressure is applied on my ears.Then I push the piece up but not pull it down as one would normally do.Compared to prior headphones I had worn many years back for listening to music, my ears do not get uncomfortably warm after a prolong use, by prolong use, I mean wearing it for 20 minutes or more.I have worn this headphones for 5 hours continuously without feeling any discomfort of warmth or pressure to my ears.4.Have not tested the limit of the battery life.But as noted above, it has served me for 5 hours of continuous use.Also,I make sure I charge it after each use. I believe that the battery life will even be longer than it is today.5.The unit is not heavy to carry but I think that as the technology improves that lighter materials will be used to make it lighter. I have not tried using it to make hand free calls with my phone.Other reviewers say that, that feature works well.6.Reconnecting to any bluetooth devise automatically has always been smooth and seamless. Has excellent memory. Have not tried other brands to compare with, I doubt I can afford to do that.I am happy with this wireless headphone and will recommend it.Cons:1. Expensive.2.The manual that came with it was not very helpful.My wishes:1.That the system automatically shut itself off after 20 seconds of being taken off from the ears, if it does not detect any pressure from the ear pieces.This will save the battery life.2.That it has a storage compartment in it you can store the wired cable.3.That it comes with an ""instructive"" instruction manual. I had to go online to download a manual that made more sense.4.That I do not have to take it off my ears to listen to someone talking to me. Planatronics unit I have read has a feature to overcome this little incovenience. By placing your palm over the right ear piece makes you hear external sound and temporarily pauses the internal sound.Removing your palm, resumes the internal sound and cancels out the unwanted external source of sound.Boss could learn a thing from Planatronics here.","Reviewed in the United States September 22, 2018",AFVHDOIMYOPBE4Y2BH72ULL4U5KQ,True,0,Color: Black
R38EDTIP1HP1E5,B0756CYWWD,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great product, but does not beat out Sony",db,4,"After weeks of research and comparison, I bought a pair of Sony WH1000XM3. A week later, my wife surprised me with a pair of Bose QC 35s (forgetting that I had already purchased the Sony's). I opened the Bose QC in order to test them, figuring I would keep the better of the two and sell the others.The reviews I had read were pretty much even between the two. Nothing really gave me confidence that one was better for my uses or my preferences than the other. Now after having both, I can say that I strongly prefer and recommend the Sony over the Bose.First and foremost - the sound out of the Sony WH1000XM3 is not only better, but you can customize it using the app. Tweak everything about the sound in the app. This is, to me the biggest point because the Bose QC 35's are surprisingly lacking in bass. I own a pair of Bose SoundSports which are great for working out, with great bass right out of the box - which is why I was so surprised that the QC would pack less of a punch than their in-ear buds. The Sony WH1000XM3 out of the box sounds good, but the ability to customize the sound through the equalizer in the app is a huge advantage over the Bose QC 35s.The touch controls on the Sony are great as well. Intuitive and responsive. The controls on the Bose are straight forward and work fine, but I do like the ability to just reach up and swipe, tap, or put my hand over the ear cup to hear the ambient sounds as opposed to finding the right button (first world problem, I know, but it is a great feature).The noise canceling is indistinguishable to me. Both work great. I could not tell a difference as I switched between the two of them while watching TV, or observing the kids while arguing. I wore the Sony for a 2.5 hour flight with no fatigue or discomfort at all. Not sure about the Bose, but I don't think they would cause any issues or discomfort - they feel pretty much the same on the head/ears.A couple additional small wins for Sony:The fact that the case comes with small sectioned off areas separated by cloth for your 3.5mm jack and USB. Bose does not have this, which means you can use the pocket on the cover (one inside and one outside) but if you use the one inside the cords are pressed into the ear cups.Sony uses USB-C. No guessing which side is up when plugging into the headphones to charge.Sony comes with an Airplane jack adapter. Even though most airlines use the single prong input now, it's nice to have, just in case.If Bose had an equalizer, the sound could most likely be made to be equal, if not better than the Sony. But the equalizer feature on the Sony WH1000XM3 enables me to really dial in the sound, leaving the Bose sounding flat in comparison. That alone puts them over the top for me. The additional features alone would not be enough for me to accept inferior quality, but I don't have to. All it together puts Sony way out ahead in my opinion.","Reviewed in the United States April 30, 2019",AEJTZTKDHYJWPRTQQOUZ5K7K7DDA,True,8,Color: Black
R1310FCL6825Q5,B0756CYWWD,4.0 out of 5 stars Sony vs Bose,Maleeha,4,"So having bought the Cowin E7 pro and then the Sony WH-1000XM3 before settling on these, I feel like I got a good chance to shop around the comparable products. I’m just going to compare the Sony vs the QC2.Personally, I was actually really sold on the Sony until I bought these. I wish I could take the pros from the Sony and the QC 2 and just merge them.In terms of comfort, the QC win for me. But it might be more of a case of personal preference. I found little online about the Sony headset being uncomfortable. In fact, the opposite was usually true. True, the ear pieces are soft and snug. But for me, it felt like they were tight enough that it cut off circulation to my ears. On more that one occasion, I noticed my face looked flushed as I was wearing them. I could not wear my Song set for longer than a couple of hours without my ears getting to sensitive, they hurt to touch. In contrast, my QC2 are not nearly as painful. As I type, I did notice that they felt tight and pulled them off. But, usually I can wear these all day long and not feel any discomfort.In terms of NC, they’re pretty much the same. The Sony have active NC that very notably feels like you sucked the noise of a room. It can also be a little uncomfortable if you’re not used to it. The Bose feel a lot less unnatural in this. I compared both on afternoon to the noise my roommate was making in the kitchen. Switched between both to see which ones did better. Genuinely couldn’t tell. There was some faint noise you could hear from both.In terms of looks, I was so in love with Sony. It’s sleek and having touch based system means there’s fewer buttons. I really wanted to keep those based on aesthetics alone. The QC2 are by no means shabby looking but when you compare the two, it’s easy to be drawn to the Sony.Features wise, they’re about the same. Sony gives you an airplane adapter that you don’t need that QC2 doesn’t. It does have this really nice feature where cupping the right earpiece causes the music to be paused so you can hear what someone is saying. I wish the QC2 had something like that.Controls feel easier on the Sony again. On the QC2 they are not hard but do require looking up how many times for you to press x button to get y action.Sound quality. Much better in the QC vs the Sony. Someone had said base is better in the Sony and but I actually think they sound better and clearer in the QC2. Sony had more options to customize. But I feel like off the Box, QC2 hase a more satisfying range. Sound leaking is about the same. Charge is about the same as well. Battery like is too.","Reviewed in the United States August 12, 2020",AGWZLC5WJEIN4BKZ7COS5PV5NIAQ,True,4,Color: Black
R28WBNBDFBFO4V,B0756CYWWD,5.0 out of 5 stars Great headphones!,Eric,5,"These are fantastic. I'm not an audiophile by any means, but I've recently been getting into gaming and wanted something that could help me stay immersed, and not bother guests, and something I could take on an airplane...a good pair of multi-purpose headphones.These knock it out of the park. Most headphones I shopped were ""good...for the price."" Or super-expensive. Finding this pair for under two bills brand new when they're as good as (and at one time were) the 300+ headphones seemed like too good a deal to pass up.Pros:1) Clear, high-quality music reproduction. Lots of speakers and headphones you feel like you are listening to a speaker playing music. With these you really feel like you are just listening to the music (or the person talking on a podcast, or what have you).2) Full music range. I discovered bass lines I never knew were there in songs I'd listened to many times before. But it's all in balance as I get the mids and highs very clear, as well.3) Super-comfortable. I am very picky, especially when it comes to items touching me, and didn't think I could have any headphones that I could wear for extended periods. I can walk around with these on all day and hardly notice. For once, advertising doesn't lie.4) Noise cancellation is superb. I never realized how loud my quiet house is (refrigerator, AC, outdoor sounds creeping in) until I spent a few hours with these on and then took them off. What a cacophony! Everything is blocked. I can't even hear a toilet I just flushed with these on! Just be careful not to miss your oven timer and burn your dinner.Cons:1) For a true audiophile, there isn't much in the way of EQ control. Ok, there isn't anything. But your source should provide that. I found the sound these put out to be perfectly balanced so I wouldn't change anything, but for those more hardcore you might not like it.For full disclosure, I've not yet tested the microphone. Suffice to say, I am ecstatic with the purchase so far. Assuming they last, I can't imagine a better set of headphones.","Reviewed in the United States March 20, 2022",AGQR6Q7OL6SWUZFSLIB5INBPWL3A,True,0,Color: Black

R2E50TU0QMP6NQ,B0756CYWWD,"4.0 out of 5 stars my 2nd purchase, good experience overall on the first",kurtbayne,4,"originally chose the Bose over the Sony because the earpieces (ears) felt better. i have these on average 6-8 hours a day: chores golf etc. Listened to audiobooks music radio youtube etc. My ears eventually wore out and it was time for a 2nd backup one. NOTE: discovered that you can buy replacement 3rd party ears online for $40? that snap off and on. I usually have pencils glasses golftees poking around my ears and that's not good. Also note: I was outside during a light, but hours-long, sprinkle and that messed with the electronics and the volume got stuck at 100%. That didn't bother me though, but beware. This updated one has Alexa, but haven't tried the hassle of setting it up. Something that would be really nice would be to tell Alexa to pause stop play and backup xx seconds for the constant interruptions by people: it's amazing how people can obviously see you with headphones on, yet decide somehow that you're not listening to anything, and don't see anything wrong with an impromptu conversation over noise-cancelling headphones. This to me is just like a 3rd person butting into a conversation and stopping it dead. It's worse actually. Twice as bad as interrupting someone while watching TV; it's like he/she's assuming that you're not watching TV at all.My main con with Bose is the charging port: using the old USB one instead of the newer one: SUCH A FRIGGING HASSLE cuz 90+% of the time I'm trying to find the hole in the dark. You can buy one of those magnetic things I suppose that you stick in the port, but I shouldn't have to. It's no exaggeration to say that I've spent a total of 5-10 FRUSTRATING hours trying to plug in to the headphones; how much is that time and hassle worth to you? If this sounds really frustrating to you, and you don't use headphones a whole lot, I suggest you fully test out the Sony headphones first. BTW these charge up pretty fast, happy with battery life. One final thing to consider: if you are going outside a lot with these, you might think about how you are going to keep your head warm in the winter and the rain with these on. I'll probably find the time to get some quality earphones so I can wear winter hats etc with them. Another sort-of con is how the headphones sometimes fall off when I'm doing something vigorous. For me, Bose has the setting just right, but I would like the option of being able to quickly adjust the uh headphone pressure depending on whether I'm sedentary or whaling on golf swings, chainsawing etc.","Reviewed in the United States November 22, 2020",AGIFTDX7YWSCCJONYGXM6Z6CZHEQ,True,2,Color: Black
R2VO3HOC24CPF4,B0756CYWWD,"5.0 out of 5 stars Great sound, noise cancellation feature, fast charging.. best comfort fit ever.. lightweight",Lorri,5,"Love this product. Summary.. comfortable, great sound quality, fast charging, great noise cancellation. Fits comfortably over my ears as I wear glasses, it doesn't hurt my head with pressure or my ears because of my glasses. I wear them hours at a time due to working remotely and have meeting around six hours a day. the noise cancellation feature is awesome especially because working from home and life/work are merged these days...and they help shut out distractions. Noise cancellation has high, low and off with a touch of a button. Also if someone is talking to you, you can rotate one earpiece to hear, or turn noise cancellation feature off. If you rotate the earphone off your ear, headphones are still comfortable. The other button on headphones works with you accepting calls, pushing play for music, or asking google to tell you of your notifications (email, text message, etc.). a great feature is that it connects to two devices simultaneously.. I use laptop for zoom meetings and cell phone. Most Bluetooth items only connect to one device at a time. However, if you are in a virtual meeting and your phone rings, the headset will mute your current conversation to allow you to address the phone call. I'd rather have this issue than not have two connections. Generally I change the setting on the phone to speaker phone when answering to solve this. It is temporary, and as soon as you hang up, the headphones are still connected, awesome. The only two things that I would do to improve this is to have a Bluetooth without having to install an app on my phone, and since I have to have it, there should be an equalizer in the Bose app. Once it's installed, as soon as you turn on the headset it automatically connects to your devices. Second is that you cannot take the headphones off and wear them around your neck.. too snug for my pleasure, but they are so comfortable, I don't have to take them off. You can adjust the length, but when I take them off, I set them down. Sound is great for conversations, but wow.. when you watch a movie, you feel like you are actually there.. pics up noises you would never hear in a movie theater.. I could go on forever, but this is very comfortable.. and has great sound. I gave it to someone to try who is 350lbs and he had no problem with comfort either..

R2E4JI7PZ9A9ZQ,B0756CYWWD,3.0 out of 5 stars Good headphones but constant Bluetooth issues,Mina,3,"I've been using these headphones for just a little over a year primarily for home and study use. Bought for Bluetooth connectivity so I could easily switch been devices so I wouldn't have to purchase multiple headsets. (Thanks Apple for taking away the headphone jack...)Overall good sound quality. Noise cancellation is a godsend when on long international flights. It doesn't completely drown out the engines but it takes it down substantially so. I was able to get decent sleep. Husband next to me could barely hear his movies when listening with cheap earbuds plugged in to the screen built into the seat in front of him, so I loaned him my Bose QC35II. I definitely noticed the difference on the noise cancellation on these versus my AirPods Pro.This thing can be a pain in the ass especially if you have a lot of Bluetooth devices. For me that would be laptop, tablet, smartphone. It seems as if the headphones are constantly trying to connect to the device that I do NOT want. Also, if you're listening to one device and get an alert on your other connected devices, it will disrupt the sound streaming from your current device and there is a delay for the sound stream to continue, so you end up missing on chunks of movie dialogue, music or news/podcast etc.I constantly have to turn my devices' Bluetooth on/off to make sure there's not disruption from unwanted connecting/disconnecting. You can only be connected to 2 Bluetooth devices at a time. You must download the Bose app in order to toggle device connection on/off. There is no Bose app (that I know of) on my Windows 10 laptop, so I have to control it from my iPhone. It's a pain.For whatever reason, on Zoom calls on my Windows laptop, the sound output may switch from Bose QC35II Stereo to Bose QC35II Hands-Free AG audio and the sound quality is total crap. I have to toggle settings or restart the headphones or the Bluetooth switch on my laptop to get it to connect correctly.There's not a major sound latency that I've noticed when streaming movies/music, HOWEVER. If you pause something and then restart, there is a huge delay - up to 10 seconds before sound continues. I notice this only with my Windows 10 laptop, which I've been having Bluetooth issues with. With my iPhone and iPad I do not notice this delay when I restart a stream after pausing. So if I'm watching a recorded lecture on my laptop and pausing/playing to keep up with note-taking, the sound delay and missed chunks is just too much for me to bear from constantly skipping back 10 second intervals to catch what I missed. I use the auxiliary cable at that point, and then what's the point of going Bluetooth to be wireless?The final and probably most painful thing is alert tones being played obnoxiously loud through the headphones. I'll be listening to music on my iPhone at normal volume and if I get some alert or notification, the tone is OBSCENELY LOUD. It makes me jump every time and want to rip my headphones off because it hurts my ears so much.Would I repurchase this? No, probably not.Would I recommend this? Only if you are not juggling Bluetooth devices so you won't have the connecting/disconnecting issue or if you are a traveler that needs decent noise cancellation.Are you an audiophile?

R225TUAGWCCXBI,B0756CYWWD,5.0 out of 5 stars Great headphones,C Dub,5,"I bought these headphones. I wore them. I loved them. They are great for noise cancelling. I may need to buy another pair because my husband used them once and now i can never find them bc they are constantly on his head. Battery life is long and even when my husband forgets to turn them off they still have about 60% left the next day when i find them. They do take a bit to fully charge but even if the battery is low you just put them on the charger for about 10 minutes and you can get quite a bit of use out of them. The charging cable is very short, probably about 13 inches stretched out. The pic only shows 11"" bc it coiled up. I like that they fold and when i take them off and just place them around my neck, the earcups pivot so that they aren't a hindrance to turning my neck. The earcups do pivot upwards and i do smudge lipstick on the ear pieces if i look down. But since it is a synthetic(?) ear piece they are easy to wipe off and no staining has set in. I also like the Bose design in folding and storage in the case. 5/5 would buy again when these wear out. The aux cord is 3mm (i believe) on the end that plugs into the headphones and the other end that plugs into your laptop, phone, device, etc., is smaller 2mm, i think. So you have to use the aux cord that came with it or make sure you have a 2mm-3mm cord if you buy a replacement. I edited my face out of the pictures to only show the way the earcups fold when they are around your neck.

R1TJ9JLGWQJD16,B0756CYWWD,5.0 out of 5 stars Google Assistant integration takes these over the top,Jordan T,5,"OVERALL OPINION:These headphones are amazing! I might have been perfectly satisfied with the first version of the QC35s, but I luckily stumbled on the second generation which includes the Google Assistant integration. I initially thought it would be a small bonus, but I totally underestimated how powerful and convenient this could be. It's more than just a trigger for voice commands. It's a surprisingly flawless implementation that allows Google Assistant to turn you into much more productive multi-tasker.GOOGLE ASSISTANT VOICE COMMANDS:You start by connecting the headphones to your phone via the 'Bose Connect' app. Now, all you have to do is press and hold the button on the left side and speak your voice command. This is a lot easier and less tedious than having to precede every command with ""OK Google"", but this isn't even the best part of this integration.GOOGLE ASSISTANT NOTIFICATIONS:The best feature of the Google Assistant integration is the ability to receive voice notifications! Whenever you receive a notification on your phone, it is automatically spoken to you on your headphones. When text messages are received, not only can you have the message read to you with a single click of the left button, but you're also presented with an immediate opportunity to send a voice-to-text response by holding the left button while speaking. This allows you to multitask like no other. The Bose Connect app allows you to choose between temporarily pausing your audio during the notification (so you don't miss a second of that podcast you were listening to) or just reducing its volume while the notification is played. You can double press the left button to shut Google Assistant up mid-notification if you ever wish to as well. It's an excellent experience.I tried smartwatches in the past, but they never seemed to deliver a convenience above and beyond what a phone could do on its own. The hands-free and vision-free experience these headphones enable fills the void we all hoped smartwatches would.CONNECTING TO TWO DEVICES:Speaking of multitasking, these headphones can be connected to two devices at a time without the fumbling and confusion that comes along with other Bluetooth headphones offering similar functionality. I’ve got mine connected to my Android phone and my Windows PC. Start playing media from either device and it’s streamed right to your headphones. To play from the opposite device, just pause the current media on the first device and then play the new media on the second device. It’s that simple. But to receive the notifications I mentioned, your current connection must be with your phone.FIT, FORM, & FUNCTION:Lastly, you might be wondering how these headphones perform as headphones. The answer is great! Check out all the reviews of the first generation for the details as I don’t think much has changed there. They’re very comfortable, lightweight, and they don’t make your ears sweat or hurt over long periods of continual usage. I explained the left button for interacting with Google Assistant in depth, but the media controls on the right are just as useful and intuitive. Double-click the play/pause button to skip to the next track and triple-click it to go back a track. The wireless range, the sound quality, and the battery life (20 hours) is all top notch for such a portable package. I haven’t tested the mic quality during a call yet, but even if it’s not the greatest, this headset has already exceeded my expectations in so many ways - I couldn’t be happier with the design.","Reviewed in the United States September 30, 2017",AF45HB2JI5CPJUTKB57PKVFVE74A,True,393,Color: Silver

R2ICHB0JMUGBLH,B0756CYWWD,4.0 out of 5 stars I desired a better range but also needed something with supreme comfort as ...,Carl Haupt,4,"If you prize comfort these are the headphones for you but it will come at the (small) cost of sound quality.I decided to pick up some ANC headphones after getting tired of the in ear buds I had been using for years. I desired a better range but also needed something with supreme comfort as I listen for hours on end while studying. A lot of people have been comparing these to a couple other sets so I will leave my thoughts around those as well.QCII: Best comfort. Well-rounded sound. Great build quality (glass fiber reinforced nylon, or so I have read). User replaceable ear pads. One thing to note is the good but uninspiring sound. It is far from poor but it has sort of a muted feel. I suppose this allows them to have good marks across a wide range of genres. Can't blame them for that. I'm satisfied with the sound as they are definitely an improvement from the hf5 buds I had been using. Google assistant is cool but I don't care about it. I have that button set to adjust ANC (high, low or off). Where is the airplane adapter? Stupid to leave it out. Also to consider - there are massive issues with Bluetooth pairing in Windows 7. It can be argued that this is not their responsibility but it's still frustrating. For those having issues search up Toshiba Bluetooth drivers for Bose - this workaround solved the issue for me. Also note that this issue is not specific to Bose. The Win7 Bluetooth stack is just garbage so you may have issues pairing with any modern wireless device.Sony WH-1000XM2: Definitely wins in the features category. Superior battery life, more lively sound, great equalizer customization in the app, touch controls and LDAC support. I kept finding myself wanting to listen to these more than the QCII. However, I could not overlook the build quality issues with reports of headband cracking. Unacceptable and not worth the risk for me. Also, I have larger ears and they were less comfortable with noticeable heating. The QCII have more space within the ear cups. The pads also got quite thin at the base of the ear during wear. This didn't compromise the seal but after removal it stayed flat and did not readily go back to a plush conformation. This may seem like a very particular critique but longevity is a concern for me and I could not help but think how long the cushioning would last. Add on top the fact that you cannot replace the ear pads and I had to rule them out.B&W PX: Amazing sound and superb sound stage. Unfortunately, too many negatives. They are heavy and caused a hot spot at the top of my head after less than an hour of use. The build quality was amazing and they looked fantastic but it was just too much weight. Sound quality takes a big hit with ANC enabled. You also cannot use them passively without battery power. They also do not collapse for easy storage. It's a shame since they sounded so good but I could not live with these downsides. Maybe the next version will fix some of these issues. I've read the P7 is a good option for those not requiring ANC.Ultimately it depends what you value. The combination of comfort and build quality with above average sound is what sold me. I hate to compromise but that's what you need to do at this price point. An ideal product would incorporate the Bose comfort, B&W sound and Sony features.","Reviewed in the United States April 15, 2018",AGXNFUCDZG2GNJBUIBXZTKQVRLOQ,True,25,Color: Black
RIDSZ1G98V1K6,B0756CYWWD,4.0 out of 5 stars They are worth the hefty price,Patricia Montemurro,4,"I received these headphones this past Christmas, and so far, so good. I am currently a college student. After having these for a couple months, this product is great for those who: workout, need something for daily use, or if you have to use noisy transportation. For me personally, I wear these daily for anywhere between 3-5 hours. I have really noticed the Bluetooth, noise cancellation/sound quality, durability, and some other miscellaneous items.Bluetooth -Loses connection 15-20 feet away from the streaming device -This can be quite frustrating due to the connection going in and out -Great for walking to class and not having to worry about the wire -Despite the Bluetooth, it comes with a regular headphone jack -This is good if you don't want to use the Bluetooth, or if they die and you can't get to a charger immediately. -Good touch for those people that are on the go, and might not have the chance to charge them.Noise Cancellation/Sound qualityA good example of the noise cancellation feature would be how I use them in the college library. People on campus like to talk about how loud the third floor is. I would equate the volume there to a restaurant that has a lot of foot traffic. While wearing these headphones, I could not hear any of the background noise, with my volume just below a quarter. You can even control how much This area of the headphones was most impressive because in the past other noise-canceling headphones did not do as good of a job with blocking out the noise.The sound quality is crisp, clear, and it makes you get lost in the music or whatever you are listening to. It really allows you to be in your own world and space.Durability - It comes in a nice padded case - Makes it easy to transport - The ears on the headphones rotate, allowing flexibility - Allows the headphones to fold, and less likely to break - Dropped them on a wood floor, no scratches or damageMiscellaneous - Three color options, fit all different interests between the black, silver, and navy - If there were more, it would be overwhelming trying to pick - Battery life is great, but how quick they charge is even better. - I've charged them for a total of 20 minutes - The battery from that short time went up 30% - While wearing them, it feels like nothing is pressing against your ears - I've had Beats before these, and my ears would start to hurt from those after a couple hours of use.All in all, I would say this is a top tier product and it really is worth the money you spend. These can really suit any needs and have made my music and podcast experience much better. I really hoped that this post helped you during your decision process.","Reviewed in the United States February 18, 2019",AGEIQJZDIOODUD5PLFTZGPXNFK7Q,True,3,Color: Black
RAQ95UKRQ5G8V,B0756CYWWD,5.0 out of 5 stars I love fricking bose so much dude.,gringo covfefe,5,"I wanted to use these headphones for a few days before I left a review. I didn't pay $349.99. I had amazon credit so I actually spent about 180. Are they worth $350? who knows. But they're deff worth the price I paid for them. When I first got them I had to download the bose connect app. After the initial download, it updated firmware- I'm guessing to get the Alexa feature on the app. I've had them for 4 or so days now. I was just about to leave a bad review until I finally realized what I was doing wrong. Turns out the action button is on the left side. So this whole time I thought Alexa wasn't working and it was just google assistant. So remember the action button for alexa etc is on the left ear, folks. Now.... I won't leave the house with these headphones... too expensive. Neighbor was getting upset that my music was too loud one night. So I needed a solution. These bose headphones was it. So here I am typing this while wearing the bose headphones with noise cancellation on. I can't hear my fingers type/click on my keyboard. I feel like i'm in an airbubble with nothing but music. It's futuristic af. I wan't to say they could be a little louder, but being in bands all my life around music pretty much shot my hearing anyways, so they're just fine. They're comfortable af. Ears don't hurt. Just what I wanted, over the ear. I swear to God i was just about to write a bad review about the alexa feature not working after spending days without itworking, come to find out there's a dang button on the left! LOL, so go ahead and buy em. As a bose fan, I give them a 5. price wise, you get what you pay for. bluetooth is simple. i don't know what nfc is, but it has that. i'm able to have my desktop computer pair with my phone at the same time, so that's rad. I can go from youtube videos on my computer to telephone calls on my phone with a hit of a button. Smart! I still can't get over this noise cancellation. I really do feel like I'm sucked in a box with nothing but music playing. Can't hear nothing from the outside. I've only charged this once and on my 4th day at 80%. with volume pretty high and noise cancellation on. App is easy to use. At least buy em, and if you don't like em. return em. You got 30 days and Amazon is good for it. i love amazon so much. Merry Christmas, folks!UPDATE: BEST HEADPHONES EVER! BEST THING I'VE EVER BOUGHT ON AMAZON IN THE PAST 2 YEARS! USE THEM EVERY DAY WHEN I GET OFF WORK. NEIGHBORS ARE HAPPY! SO GOOD! BUY THEM! 7/14/19","Reviewed in the United States November 30, 2018",AFJPINKB62DKSAOPNADUD6IUE7RQ,True,15,Color: Black
R14V0Q6SNARM8G,B0756CYWWD,4.0 out of 5 stars U Fly Mike and Bose Quiet Comfort 35.,blade4.productions,4,"The sound quality and comfort of the Bose quiet 35 is awesome. However. If you are a professional pilot and thinking about getting the U fly MIKE and Bose quiet 35, for your solution as far as pilot Headsets go? Think very long and careful about what you are attempting to do.On my second rotation out I was setting up my Bose 35 and you fly Mike for a short hob over to San Francisco from Oakland airport. Piece of cake so I thought.Just as we were starting our taxi out I was having some problems and microphone issues with the two productsAs it turned out just before takeoff, I looked at my Headsets and my horror do you fly Mike Jack broke right off inside my Bose 35s.And I was left to using the overhead speakers and “trucker Mike“ so to speak on our way over to San Francisco.Not a situation that produces warm fuzzies when I just spent 600+ dollars between the two products.Supposedly you fly Mike is repairing the microphone jack assembly however I am once and done when it comes to reliability of the U fly mic.On my next paycheck I went ahead and bought the Bose 1200 certified pilot headset and haven’t been happier with Headsets. They are very very well-made they can take the where in tear the professional pilots rely on when entering and exiting cockpits going to the hotels etc. etc. you get my point.I would say if you’re a part 91 guy on a managed aircraft that you may be use these things six times a year if that? Than this you fly Mike is a nice inexpensive way To have a lightweight comfortable headset solution.But if you need the durability that goes along with a line pilot type lifestyle. I would try to make whatever you’re using now last until you can save the money for a much more superior headset such as the Bose 1200. Yes it was expensive nearly $1200 in fact but it will probably be the last headset I ever need to buy.And of course your mileage may vary. Hope this helps.","Reviewed in the United States December 2, 2021",AHE5Z2ES5F62EW3TSGMS2OQJBWZQ,True,0,Color: Black
RO51OJQ9EUNTD,B0756CYWWD,4.0 out of 5 stars Tried and True Premium Headphones with Extreme Comfort,Dale,4,"[Update: May 2021] I love these headphones more and more every time I put them on. They continue to be unbelievably comfortable. I’ve never once even had the slightest hint of discomfort yet, even after a couple hours of continued use. You really forget they’re even on.They pair in three seconds or less. Every time. I’ve never had an issue with connectivity. And that sliding on/off button? Still awesome. It makes it so easy to turn them on and off opposed to holding a button for a few seconds.The only upgrade I wish they had was auto stop/start recognition. That’s a really useful feature that I do miss from when I tried the Sony’s. But seriously, these are perfect aside from that one wished for enhancement.- - - - -[Original Review: April 2021] I’m going to try to make this as to the point, but detailed as possible.PROS:• Clean, crisp music• Amazingly comfortable• Physical buttonsCONS:• Price (when not on sale)• No EQ control• Getting outdatedSimply put, these headphones just work. They deliver quality music with extreme comfort. I used them side by side with the Sony WH-1000XM4’s for about a week and while they can’t compete in terms of music quality, their comfort ultimately won out in the head to head battle for which I keep.I would liken these headphones to an Apple product. Sure, you can find competition that’s better at certain elements, but you’re paying for a tried and true brand that you know you’re going to get high performance from for years to come. What other consumer electronic was released in 2018 and is still one of the most sought-after products three years later? That speaks volumes in and of itself.I particularly enjoy the sliding on / off button. Having the ability to connect to two devices at once is really useful for working remote (laptop and phone). I’m also surprised at how well the self-voice works to bring your voice into the headphones while on a phone call. This in particular works better than Sony’s version.In summary, the Sony’s sound better. I can confidently say that. However, the Bose are more comfortable and are a fantastic all-around winner. BUY THEM! You won’t be disappointed.","Reviewed in the United States April 13, 2021",AFHLYFDIMB7XI5GIXYI5CWD33TUQ,True,1,Color: Black
R6QYXYRTU8PZG,B0756CYWWD,5.0 out of 5 stars Just what I needed it!,Gretchen Schmidt,5,"I love my Bose QuietComfort 35 II Noise Cancelling Headphones. They were an investment I'm really glad I made. It's amazing how much they cancel out so I can really focus on what I need to.I did my research beforehand, so I knew just what noise cancelling meant and what to expect because I wanted to be realistic. Do they cancel out the dog barking or my husband in the same room talking, no. But they did block out the tv in the other room, my husband on a business call in his office, and a kid playing a video game in the room above me. They also block out the sound of the air conditioner, street traffic, my laptop fan, and the lawn services on our street with all their mowers. In our own yard I can barely hear my husband use the lawnmower, the closer he gets to my location, I can hear the rumble more but it's pretty minor.Will these take away all sound like sounds doesn't exist? No. They will however mute everything so much that it feels like silence. It’s that absence of all those noises that really help me to tune in to the task at hand and focus. If you’ve never had noise cancelling headphones before, I would suggest doing a quick search to learn how they work, about high and low frequencies, and what to expect.I don’t use the app though I did download it for the basic set up the headphones. It doesn’t really do much and coming from a pair of basic over the ear headphones that didn’t have an app, I don’t find it necessary. I have my headphones hooked up to my phone and laptop. They connect no problem and if I stay within the 30-ish ft. range, they stay connected. I think the sound quality is great, I have been using them while working (with and without music) and to listen to audiobooks. They are lightweight and very comfortable. I wear them for long periods while working or reading. I wear reading glasses and don’t have any discomfort when both the headphones and the glasses are on at the same time. I’ve tested them out with phone calls with no problems and the person on the other end couldn’t tell I was using headphones.I picked this particular pair because I liked the simplicity of an on/off button and easy volume controls. I work from home so these suite my needs perfectly.","Reviewed in the United States July 16, 2020",AGT7ILGVXQ6MLYWLHW7FJIFCXPQA,True,5,Color: Rose Gold
R1DH3TXXXYWRCK,B0756CYWWD,5.0 out of 5 stars My comparison: Bose vs Sony,jswest,5,"OK, my personal comparison of the Sony WH-1000Xm2 and the Bose is complete. After reading all the reviews, the Sony seemed to win out, but with Amazon's generous return policy, I purchased both and did a several hour comparison yesterday. Both are great, but here's what pushed me over the edge for Bose.1. Sound. I am not an audiophile so the terms I use in this section to describe what I experienced may be technically incorrect terms, so bear with me. The Bose sound is amazing. It is crisp and clean and full. I can hear so much more in the same music I have been listening to for years. It's hard to explain but the Sony seemed compressed while the Bose feels full. The highs are better on the Bose and the there is separation in the music. The bass on the Sony seems louder, but not crisp and clean like it does on the Bose. The Sony sound is very good but compressed and almost muddy compared to the Bose. I know reviews say the Sony sounds better, but I just don't hear it that way. I found myself cutting my Sony tests short so I could go back to the Bose.2. Comfort. The Bose is lighter and more comfortable for me. The Sony felt heavy in comparison.Every other feature became unimportant to me after hearing the sound and feeling the comfort. Both eliminated noise and did everything else fine.Nothing against the Sony WH-1000Xm2 - it is an excellent product, but for me I'm keeping the Bose and sending back the Sony's.","Reviewed in the United States December 20, 2017",AHNKW7TBRZ3V2WKCQ46BRWBTP4QA,True,2385,Color: Silver
R1SMD9Z7XU8QXB,B0756CYWWD,5.0 out of 5 stars The best for call quality,TheCatGuy,5,"I bought these headphones 3 years ago and they are absolutely worth every penny. The sound quality is fantastic but where these headphones really shine is for calls. They are excellent at filtering ambient noise and isolating your voice. I can mow the lawn and still have a normal conversation on the phone.Tests - I have a pair of AirPods Pro and I ran some tests to compare the two headphones/earbuds. Call quality is higher on the Qc 35 ii's. The Airpods have this tinny, water trickling effect that makes it hard to understand voices sometimes. I've also noticed that the airpods require perfect alignment to work well. If one ear is a little off, you come in faint. The Qc 35 ii's are crystal clear. Music quality is a closer race - I feel the Pros have clearer mids and the 35 ii's have stronger bass. About what you'd expect from earbuds vs headphones. It's more of a preference thing. Sometimes I prefer the Pros and vice versa.Battery - the battery lasts a long time. I don't have a specific number but it lasts longer than my airpods and every other headphone set I've ever had. It charges via micro-usb and charges quickly so a 30 minute charge will get you back near full battery.Durability - top notch. These headphones have taken a beating. I've sat on them, thrown them in my backpack, and generally just toss them on the floor beside my bed when I'm done by them. This style of use has destroyed every other headphones I've ever had after about a year. These headphones? Still completely intact. I've run with these headphones, gotten them icky with sweat. I replaced the cups earlier this year after they started tearing. Costed under $20 and replacing them was easy, you literally just pop them in.Overall, these have met my expectations for music but far exceeded them for calls, build quality, and battery. I've spent 1500 hours on the phone since I got these and they are worth it.Tl;dr I bought these as an impulse buy in 2018 and they are worth every penny. These are the best for calls.","Reviewed in the United States July 11, 2021",AHH2KZZZOJZHRVJCAMCEIL7MJQGA,True,1,Color: Black
R2NTPD39ZHWPWT,B0756CYWWD,5.0 out of 5 stars Still A Top-Tier Choice,R. D. Clark,5,"The QC35II has been around a long time, and offerings from other companies and even from Bose themselves would seem to have eclipsed them.But first, comfort is subjective. If you expect to spend hours every day wearing your phones, trying on several different designs will reward you. I've been wearing headphones for work and pleasure for more than 50 years, and these are simply the most comfortable over-ear phones I've ever owned. Your head may vary; mine is a giant Irish one. These are more comfortably, to me, than the newer Bose 700 or than any Sony models.Second, value varies with price. These are still premium phones, so if you see them on sale at a really low price they could be a true bargain. I've seen sales recently offering these for close to half the price of the 700; that's a deal I'd jump on.Third, they sound great, and I say that without qualification. They are within the window of accuracy and naturalness that, IMO, anyone can acclimate to. They are clear, balanced, full-range, and don't change the character of the music. They don't do sonic tricks, either, so if you want your headphones to somehow enhance or exaggerate your music, look elsewhere. I know Bose uses active equalization and that some purists turn up their noses at that, but the real-life effect is more natural sound. Dozens of independent third-party tests confirm this.Fourth, they do all the basics of BT headphones quite well. They pair and connect with my OnePlus 6, my iPad, my Windows PC, all easily and repeatably. They stay connected when I walk into the next room. They hold a charge for many hours, and recharge quickly.Finally, this is still world-class noise cancellation. Put them on, turn them on, start your music, and the world goes away. Of course, no ANC can filter non-repeating, staccato, or very loud sounds, but these do the best that can be done. The cans themselves are effective sound-deadeners.Bose marketing, combined with some over-hyped, poor-value products, has made the company a favorite target of some commenters on the industry. I even agree with them about most Bose home-entertainment products. But Bose makes some very good pro-audio and architectural equipment, and they make some really good consumer headphones, too. These may be the best of them.","Reviewed in the United States November 13, 2020",AG7DTDZ5HHZWYDGL2ZOIZGQINHMQ,True,1,Color: Black

I had to replace the ear cuffs but other wise no complaints still. Battery life and sound quality still going strong!)Edit:( Its October 2022 and I still wear these near daily, and they still hold up! Battery life is still just about as long. One complaint is that the actually cloth part of the headset is hard to clean and I had to replace the ear cups. The leather section at the top is also experiencing light peeling, but again, I wear these daily to work and around the house so they see an exceptional amount of wear. Im still quite pleased with my purchase. )I wear these products near daily and they are fantastic in terms of durability and sound. The swivel of the headset is still great, despite the constant wear, no lasting damage. Noise cancelation, battery life are still excellent, was especially impressed by how good the battery life is even after extensive use, still lasts all day and then some when on for hours. It is not bass boosted so well like say Beats, but the sound is clear. The Bluetooth distance isn't the greatest, but fine for me since my phone is on my person. For gaming they are pretty good, as directional sound is adequate and clear, but perhaps not as great as an open back headset.One gripe I still have had since day one is the software. I use the app, but if you have registered it to any other device and turn it on, you have a 75% chance it will jump over from the active device you are listening to to the new one. You then have to go in and turn off the other device availability. I also have had issues with the app not loading properly.Other then that, I heartily recommend these headphones.","Reviewed in the United States March 19, 2022",AEOLFWKBTVTKVAQA7USL4JB6UT7Q,True,1,Color: Rose Gold
R1HW146K955U2D,B0756CYWWD,5.0 out of 5 stars Best active noise-cancelling on-ear headphones money can buy,Aris,5,"I am a headphones and Hi-Fi enthusiast or audiophile if you will. This review is for casual and audiophile users.Sound:Very good sound 4/5 stars. Extended tight bass (that can be dialled down via the app at will), good definition, good musicality. Voices and single instruments don't sound ""real"" but music comes out with great enjoyment and overall rhythm and warm pleasant tones. You can listen to music for hours in these. They never sound like ""you're really there at a live venue"" - like better and more expensive headphones do - but 99% of people don't care and won't notice. You buy these headphones because they do everything rather well, and have active noise cancelling. Tip: If you really want the best sounding headphones around this price and you MUST have noise cancelling check-out the Shure 535 in-ear headphones which have far superior sound in every way and better (alas passive) noise-cancelling. Bottom line: these headphones are best value, just before diminishing returns where more money buys you fine improvements, whereas less money buys you significantly worst headphones.My experience: Music and Hi-Fi fanatic for 20 years. Own multiple DAC's all the way up to $2000 devices, multiple $500+ headphones which I used to compare these headphones against streaming both Spotify as well as lossless Tidal.Comfort:These truly are the most comfortable over-ear headphones you can buy. They are light, fit beautifully with materials that feel soft and welcome to your head. Hours of easy listening await you. If comfort and noise cancelling is a priority for you look no further.Noise Cancelling:Myth buster first: You don't need active noise-cancelling. Passive in-ear headphones have better passive noise cancelling. The reason why you buy active noise-cancelling is either because you prefer to have on-ear rather than in-ear headphones, OR because you like to turn the noise-cancelling off some times. If you don't mind smaller and more travel-friendly in-ear headphones and don't mind having passive noise-cancelling on at all times. Do try a pair of Shure 535's before committing to on-ear headphones. All that said, Noise-cancelling on the bose is Very good 8/10.Other:Battery, connectivity, features, functionality are all top notch. You will not find better.Overall I give these 5/5 stars not because they are the best headphones in the world - they are not. But they are the best on-ear noise-cancelling headphones in the world, and if you don't care for ""astoundingly clear audiophile grade sound"" - these are best value for the price.Should you buy them? Yes. You will not regret it. You either know what professional and audiophile headphones and DACs sound like, in which case you wouldn't be looking at these headphones OR you don't know that you need better headphones yet, so these are the best headphones you can currently appreciate, and a great way to step into the world of great sound.","Reviewed in the United States December 20, 2017",AEFP7NP6JNUD3CYUUOBAJKXU4PVA,True,25,Color: Silver

I purchased the quiet comfort 35 ll headphone in May 2019. For a year and a half, I have loved everything about my Bose headphones, and would give them five full stars for its fantastic quality, features, and comfort. However, I am very disappointed in the quality of the Bose quiet comfort 35 ll Headphone ear cushions. After slightly more than a year and a half, one of the ear cushions began to tear, and the insides came out, ripping the cushion even more. I tried looking on Amazon and on the Bose website to find replacement quiet comfort 35 Headphone ll cushions, and could not find them anywhere. The closest I could find are the Bose quiet comfort 25 headphone cushions, which I had bought several years ago because my previous Bose headphones had the same problem. I tried looking for replacement cushions on Amazon, and on the Bose website it just told me not to bother calling because the wait is too long, and gave me advice on how to replace your cushions but I could not find information on how to get the cushions for the quiet comfort 35 version two. I thought I saw something in the Amazon write up for the quiet comfort 25 headphone cushions that said they might work on the 35 II so I bought those for $37.61. I tried following the instructions that came with it to replace the broken ear cushion, and after a long time trying, did not seem to fit properly. I am very frustrated, and do not believe that Bose should be charging $350 for headphones, then take its customers through hell trying to replace substandard headphone ear cushion kits without sufficient information and ear cushion kits that don’t fit.I have revised my review up to four stars since I was ultimately able to get the ear cushion fit into the headphone, sound quality is excellent and noise cancellation is also excellent, and it worked. The Bose headphone itself is fantastic, so now I just penalize it one star for the hassle of having the air cushion needing replacement from normal use after one and a half years, and Bose making it so difficult to find the ear cushion and install it.","Reviewed in the United States February 9, 2021",AHDM7AKAFGIYRA5QJOJYLL2IM2NA,True,0,Color: Black
R3A0GQL2G0RFN1,B0756CYWWD,5.0 out of 5 stars Noise “Reduction” Headphones,Mrs.T,5,"4/20/20 Just a quick update - these won’t completely block out all noise, but they do greatly reduce it. My husband is currently working from home and as he’s doing a lot of Zoom meetings, I bought the Bose headphones thinking by the name - Noise Canceling - it would 100% cancel all noise, they do not. I can still hear my husband speaking. If I raise the volume on the music I’m listening to, it eliminates the noise...but I don’t want to go deaf trying to temporarily block out sound. Bottom line...I still love these headphones, and they tremendously help with noise, they just don’t live up to the hype in their advertising. I did not deduct any stars for this because I am still really pleased with my purchase.Original review - I needed a set of noise canceling headphones and since my husband is on his second Bose headphones (he loves them), I decided to order these. The sound is awesome, of course. I like that there are three levels of noise cancellation - high, low, and off. Even in the off position, there is some reduction of noise simply because your ears are covered. I found the materials used made the headphones quite comfortable to wear. The controls buttons and switches are easy to use. Using the headphones to take a phone call was easy and I was told my voice was crystal clear.In regard to the Bose app, yes you have to download it to your device. However, once it was installed, I’ve never had to do anything with the app since. Once I paired both my iPad and my iPhone to the headphones, no matter if I’m reading on my iPad and decide to listen to music on my iPhone (as a test), the music immediately came through my headphones - I did not have to use my Bluetooth settings to disconnect/connect anything - it was automatic. If you have a third device, then you’ll have to manually select one to disconnect in order to pair with the third device.I am not a pink kind of girl, nor a fan of rose gold...but I opted for these headphones in the rose gold and I’m glad I did. I like that the color is different and that it’s a soft, slightly bronze-ish rose gold.","Reviewed in the United States April 17, 2020",AGYMJT5SBE5OOMOTS3OFT36WRRFA,True,1,Color: Rose Gold
R31OJQK6XN6H33,B0756CYWWD,5.0 out of 5 stars Very very pleased with the Bose QuietComfort 35 II Wireless Bluetooth Headphones,Craig Phillips,5,"I've hesitated to purchase noise cancelling headphones in the past, primarily due to the cost. (Can I afford them? Heck yes. Are they a necessity? Not really.) I happened to catch the sale on these Bose headphones, and so glad I purchased them (actually, I purchased a pair for me, and for my wife). We both love the headphones. I never knew exactly what ""noise cancelling"" headphones cancelled, but after putting them on, several of the noises in my house disappeared (including the running fan above my head). If my wife speaks up louder than normal, I can hear her, otherwise most small sounds are rendered quiet or muted. I will definitely bring these for air travel once that kicks in again in 2021.The sound quality for my music is also good. I've played everthing from Motley Crue to Vivaldi, and all music sounds great to my ear, I found nothing missing from the high or low end of the spectrum. The build quality appears to be solid, and once you learn how to use the manual controls, it's very easy to answer a call, skip or pause a song, or turn the volume up or down. Also, I can control my Siri through the physical controls (Amazon Alexa as well, but requires installing that app on my iPhone). The Bose app is required to connect the headphones to your phone via bluetooth, but there's a manual audiojack port for a physical connection. The app itself is fairly straightforward, and has controls for music sharing, noise cancellation (varying levels), loudness of yourself talking, standby timer, voice prompts, language, and a product tour that provides a brief description of your headphones and function. The cushioning on the earpieces is very comfortable as well, and of course the placement is adjustable (for shorter or longer faces/heads). Battery life seems more than adequate, I wear these for several hours a day and over a three-day period battery power remaining has never been below 50%. They also appear quick to charge to a full battery.After using these phones for about a month, I wouldn't hesitate to buy them at the full price, but it was very nice to get them on sale.","Reviewed in the United States December 8, 2020",AENOTHTNTWWSNPWDDEHER6GUWRVA,True,2,Color: Silver

I use this on pretty much every flight I take. I love the sound quality of these headphones and honestly I have no reason to seek for more. Comfort wise this is 10/10 as well, I barely, if ever, get ear fatigue wearing these. And the Noise-Cancellation is amazing. For me the noise cancellation was a gamechanger. As a night shift nurse, I found it especially hard trying to sleep in the day after my night shift. Throwing these eye with the noise cancellation provided me with the quiet comfort I desperately needed. If I had the choice to go back and decide to purchase this again, I would definitely do it in a heartbeat.","Reviewed in the United States November 30, 2023",AF4LOFHIK4W2EWFHZVXQLOHKYN2Q,True,0,Color: Black
RQ8KBMCSTUI8I,B0756CYWWD,4.0 out of 5 stars Bose QC 35 vs Sony WH-1000XM3,djsh4dowfan,4,"I purchased both both Bose QC 35 and Sony WH-1000XM3 headphones. I ended up returning the Sony headphones. Here is my comparison of the two:- Both have very good active noise cancellation (ANC)- Both have good sound, although the Sonys probably have more base, which I personally liked- Both come with an app you can install on your phone to configure them to an extent. The Sonys are more configurable, with an EQ and more granular noise cancellation.- The Sonys have an adaptive noise cancellation feature that will change the ANC level based on where you are and what you are doing (e.g., sitting vs traveling). I personally don't care about this feature or find it that useful.- I found the Bose to be more comfortable and easier to fold up put away. The Sony earpads weren't as soft, and the headphones clamped down on my head with more pressure.- I found the Sonys to have more intense ANC overall. My ears are sensitive to ANC, and I get the feeling of having pressure in my ears with ANC enabled. That feeling was much less intense on the Bose, even on high, despite the Bose having very good ANC, which gave me the impression that the Sony ANC was more brute force and less accurate.- The Sonys have neat touch controls for volume, play/pause, prev/next, etc. While it's a cool feature, it wasn't something I cared that much about, and I was often worried I was going to accidentally change something when taking the headphones off and on. I don't think the buttons on the Bose headphones detract from their looks.- The Bose can connect up to 2 devices at once, which is pretty nice. I can be connected to both my phone and my laptop and seamlessly switch between them.Ultimately I returned the Sony headphones because I found the Bose to be more comfortable. My biggest gripe about both pairs of headphones is they do not save your last ANC setting! I cannot believe this feature was overlooked. I don't plan on using ANC all of the time. If I turn the ANC to low or completely off, when I turn the headphones off and on again, it will reset to high. The Sony app even allows you to configure the ANC at a granular level and allows you to configure the ANC for different usage patterns when the adaptive ANC is on; however, those settings also didn't persist, making them basically useless. I found the Sony Android app to be pretty buggy in general. I would strongly prefer an actual physical switch for the ANC setting instead of just having the setting be software controlled.","Reviewed in the United States August 30, 2019",AHSAIY3FLNCBVIQTXLS6VKRLKYTA,True,2,Color: Black

That, and the sound was empty and flat compared with either Sony or Bose. What was most surprising to me was they didn't have strong bass, which I had thought they were known for.I put on the Sony and they were bigger but somewhat better fitting, not a lot lighter, but with more of a clear and full range from high to low.I put on the Bose and it was surprisingly and significantly lighter and better fitting than either of the others and the sound was basically perfect. Good bass, full range of highs and lows. I have to admit that I had to switch back and forth between the Sony and the Bose about 10 times to determine if I *really* preferred the Bose to the Sony, and they were actually pretty darn close. The final element that tilted the scales in favor of Bose was they were so much lighter and better fitting, which was paramount for me since I'd be using them for exercise, so I took a 1/10th of a point of the Sony. If I was the type of person who uses headphones for sitting around enjoying music, the weight and fit would be less important and the music quality would be almost everything, and then I'd probably have to switch between the Bose and Sony another 10-20 times to figure out what the difference is and what I prefer. It's subtle; equal but different. It may come down to a matter of individual preference and the type of music you listen to.In addition to all of the above, as I've continued to use the Bose for 'everything' - I was most surprised when on a whim I decided to see if I could place a call with them; and my two initial callers both exclaimed that this was the BEST and clearest sound talking to me they had yet experienced (For years I've tried their patience through testing calls with 10-15 different best rated wired and wireless headpieces, ear buds et al). The rave reviews of the recipients of my calls carried from inside to outside walking the streets of NYC with all the usual sirens and traffic noise.But most important of all, I can listen to my music in full head-filling gorgeous energizing glory when I'm exercising.Final score:Bose 5 starsSony 4.9 starsBeats 3 stars","Reviewed in the United States February 10, 2018",AGQNW6VLSB5J6ZVRFUJD5OXULBWA,True,139,Color: Silver
R1D7P166BON2QE,B0756CYWWD,4.0 out of 5 stars I am not an audiophile but I am extremely picky about what I like and don't,Danielle,4,"Bought these and the Sony WH-1000Xm2 noise canceling headphones.I already have owned and been using a wired Beats Studio noise canceling headphone for the last 4 years.I've got Bose wired and Bluetooth sport headphones, AKG buds (came with my S8), Apple buds (came with IPhone 6), Sensier buds and various other sets.Sound Quality is subjective so really I think everyone has to try each headphone out for themselves. I am not an audiophile but I am extremely picky about what I like and don't, subtle differences make a big difference to me. To me, the Sony headsets sound the best out of any of the headphones I own, wired or Bluetooth, noise canceling or non noise canceling.Noise Canceling - Sony and Bose were neck and neck, very little difference except... the Sony app let's you do some useful stuff with the Noise Canceling, set it to filter out ambient noise but not voices so you can hear announcements in the airport. It can be set to an active setting that monitors your movement, opens up what you hear if you are moving for safety reason. Gesture sensitivity - you can cup your hand over the right ear and the headphones shut down all but for the mic that allows you to hear someone.Features - Sony hands down has more features than any headphone I have seen on the market. Adjust the noise canceling levels as referenced above, set EQ to make meaningful adjustments to sound quality. There is a feature that has preset surround sound settings which appears useless, sound quality sounds terrible in any of the setting so unsure why it's included on the app. Touch features for volume, pause, play, answering calls.Bluetooth functionality - both the Sony and Bose had the best sound quality of any Bluetooth headset I own. Bose wins out for functionality as it will allow you to be connected to 2 devices at that same time. Useful if you are traveling, are using them with your phone and you then want to watch a movie on your tablet or computer. Bose, no problem, Sony you have to disconnect from your phone and then connect to the other device.Comfort - Bose wins hands down - no contest. The Sony's are comfortable but not on the same level as the Bose which are the most comfortable headphone I have every worn.If I was ranking them purely on sound quality alone - Sony, Beats and then the Bose.Overall I prefer the Sony's due to the sound quality, noise canceling performance, features, customization and Bluetooth performance. If you are looking for comfort and noise canceling above all else, Bose would be the winner. Both the Sony and Bose are great traveling headphones in my opinion, if you are looking for a set, really think everyone needs to try both as almost people review is subjective beyond the features and connectivity aspects.","Reviewed in the United States February 24, 2018",AH4WW5TGOFR3ZUOGDPVX2YZQGP5Q,True,4,Color: Black
RXCPNHVK3JHKK,B0756CYWWD,4.0 out of 5 stars Happy with purchase but please read the caution!,Amazon Customer,4,"UPDATE: I decided to go ahead and let the firmware update to 4.5.2. because I was still within the 30 day return window. Fortunately, I did not experience any degradation in the ANC after doing so. Apparently, the firmware update issue does not occur on all headphones and I got lucky. I am very happy with my QC's.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I wanted to order the Bose QC35 ii’s in rose gold due to the significant price reduction. However, I remembered hearing about an issue with firmware updates degrading the quality of the ANC on these. I researched the issue and found that this is indeed a problem for many people. If you download the Bose app and then connect Bluetooth between your phone and the QC’s the latest firmware will automatically download.I still wanted to take advantage of this deal, so here is what I did. The QC35 ii’s that I received had firmware update 4.1.3 which I learned was the last update prior to two other problematic ones which were supposed to further “improve the AR functionality”. These two firmware updates are 4.3.6 and the latest 4.5.2. All of the Bose and Reddit blog information says NOT to update to either the 4.3.6 or 4.5.2 firmware updates because they can result in a serious degradation to the quality of the ANC. Also, Bose no longer allows you to go back to the previous firmware version after updating.In order to avoid having the firmware update to automatically occur:1. Download the Bose app onto your phone2. Put your phone into AIRPLANE MODE3. Connect the Bluetooth between your phone and the QC35 ii’s4. In the app menu, for future reference make note of the firmware uprade number that is on your QC’s and note the manufacturing date of the headset by selecting settings, scroll down to product info.5. Set up the function you prefer for the Action Button, either Alexis, Google or levels of ANC.6. Delete the app from your phone7. Go out of airplane mode.The app does not really offer any more functionality than you can achieve without it, plus you are in control as to when or if you want to update your firmware. There is no EQ function on it.Other than the potential firmware issue, I highly recommend the QC35 ii’s for both sound and ANC quality.","Reviewed in the United States February 25, 2020",AFJC4JH2URNHUCYJYCCGT6Z7OMRA,True,4,Color: Rose Gold
R3FM0YEJM0M5QR,B0756CYWWD,5.0 out of 5 stars Works Great - Better than expected,Chris Walken,5,"I purchased the QuietComfort 35 II's to replace perfectly fine but aging wired QuietComfort 15's. The main noise I want to block is lawn mowers. In the summer every single day lawn equipment noise can be heard up and down the street. Their leaf blowers sound like a Gulfstream G550 on takeoff from a short runway. I have had these for several weeks now and the QuietComforts block the lawn worker's sound perfectly. Even when a mower is just outside my window the sound is reduced from a brain rattling assault to just a small nuisance. Lawn equipment down the street is not even heard. As far as how loud music sounds with the headset, I have no idea. I mainly listen to quiet classical and ambient and for that type of music they are fantastic. Battery life is stated at 15 hours and that's probably accurate. When they power up a voice tells you how much battery is left. The bluetooth range between an iMac and the headset works all over a 3,600 sq foot two story home. The bind with bluetooth on an iMac is better and more seamless than anything I have seen to date. Just switch on the headset and 3-4 seconds later it connects every single time. They will try to bind to two things at once and that can be annoying if that's not your intention. That leads to probably the only negative with the headset and that is it takes yet another app to set them up. Painfully. Once they are setup via the app, the app can be tossed. Also the 2nd device can be removed by simply un-paring it on the device. No idea how well Alexa works with it as I opted to not use that nonsense. I just needed noise canceling and for that purpose these are amazing. They are light and can be worn for hours comfortably.

R6OBYH1FMH4RK,B0756CYWWD,5.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic purchase for working from home,B. W.,5,"I teach, and I purchased these to help with my transition to teaching from home after my school and my daughter's preschool closed due to the coronavirus.Before these headphones, I had a hard time hearing what my students were saying during online meetings - either because of my loud preschooler playing in the house or random noises in the house (air conditioner, fans, dehumidifier, etc.). The noise canceling properties of these things are fantastic - there have been several days when my husband (who watched our child while I was in meetings) was shocked that I didn't hear all the noise that the little one was making. These are fantastic for drowning out background noise so I could really concentrate on what I was trying to listening to, and I honestly think that these headphones were an essential component of me being able to effectively work from home. On the flip side, I do not recommend them for anyone with a young child that doesn't have someone else watching the kid while wearing these.Something that I didn't expect was how excellent the microphone is! I have been making videos for my students so they can review the lectures and material at their own pace, and the sound quality of the microphone is impressive - much better than what I would have expected from a microphone that isn't positioned near my mouth. It is nice to have a consistent distance from the microphone so I know that I will be heard consistently even if moved around a bit while talking; it is painfully clear which of the videos were made using my computer's built-in mic and which I made using this headset, and in online video chats with friends, they commented on how improved my sound quality was when wearing these things.I think they are comfortable - I will typically wear them between one to three hours at a time. I wear glasses with plastic frames - the additional pressure the headphones puts on my glasses does get a little annoying, but I can't imagine any large noise-canceling headphones being significantly more comfortable.","Reviewed in the United States July 29, 2020",AHZAXMTC75DITIFXEFBKUDETA6FQ,True,0,Color: Rose Gold
R2SQJFKR8099HQ,B0756CYWWD,5.0 out of 5 stars i love the color on these,John Chen,5,"These are amazing and Bose is great! I purchased these headphones for their noise-cancellation abilities. I am an application developer and wear them at work because I am easily distracted. I don't even listen to music with them... they just cancel just about all background noise, including random chatter from the annoying marketing department. I also use them for WebEx and Skype calls with clients. The built-in microphone is great and the noise-cancellation is helpful during those calls as well. Battery life is extremely good. I can go an entire week without having to charge the headset. It comes with an 1/8"" cable that will allow you to listen to music even when the batteries are dead. An added feature is that the bluetooth feature will allow you to connect to and hear audio from two sources at the same time. This is great if you want to connect to your iPhone and laptop at the same time.After a month of use, the headphones button would no longer work to pair to a new device. It would still power on and off, just the pairing didn't function. Bose support was difficult to deal with. At first the support technician didn't think there was anything wrong with the headset. After a frustrating conversation, he relented and sent me instructions for sending them back to the manufacturer. This would mean that I would be without my precious headphones for at least two weeks. The next day prior to dropping the headphones at UPS I came across The Bose Store at Tysons Corner Mall. I had the headphones with me so I decided to speak to one of the employees there. After a very brief conversation, and even though I purchased these through Amazon, he walks over to a display, gets me a brand new set of headphones and proceeds to exchange my defective ones for the new set. No other questions asked. He just said ""We like to take care of our customers"".

I'm finally doing well for myself and I work in sporadically loud and high intensity office. Those discussions usually do not involve me and so I like to toss these guys on. I actually wear them all day. Great quality and comfort. I leave one ear off because the noise cancelation is no joke and sometimes people call to me over the cubicle wall and I have to be able to hear them, but when things ramp up and I'm not involved, I can cover my ear and loud conversations happening a couple feet away from me get very quiet and I can concentrate.They are expensive, but they're worth it. Some of the best sound quality I've ever had, especially matched with that ""HD"" music from amazon music.Calls are crystal clear. You can hear your own voice talking back, but it's not so loud that it distracts you. It's just a comfort knowing your mic is working well. With the noise cancelation, it really helps you concentrate on a call - which is helpful where I work.Battery lasts a full couple work days. I charge it a couple times a week overnight. It hasn't gotten close to low yet.I suppose my only complaint would be the charging cord being about 3 inches long. It's that older style charger that looks like a trapezoid, not the new C charger.

I was a loyal Bose buyer, but this device and my Revolve SoundLink can only be used on one device without a fifteen minute process of resetting from scratch (often requiring multiple attempts).

R2Z13CKQKR2708,B0756CYWWD,"4.0 out of 5 stars Solid all-arounders, a bit overpriced",Lanugo,4,"A good headset. It's not for studio usage or audiophiles but it will do whatever you throw at it quite decently. I bought this to replace my older QC25 which were having issues after a while and I've been using it all day long for a couple of months now.Bluetooth works pretty intuitively. If you have more than 2 devices paired it can get slightly annoying to force it to connect to the one you want but it never gets frustrating.There is a supporting mobile application that helps with firmware updates, configuration, etc).Noise reduction is significant but could be a bit stronger and less hissy. It feels like the high setting could be pushed a bit higher. Notably, noise reduction doesn't seem to work while the microphone is active (so during skype/zoom calls, etc).There are volume buttons, a generic play/pause/whatever button and one for noise reduction. These are all very welcome. Feedback is aural, there are voice notifications I disabled immediately because they temporarily silence whatever you're listening to to announce that connection to such and such device is lost.Battery life is on the short side. You will drain the headset if you have it on all day. On the flip side, it charges quite quickly through micro-USB even with an old, slow USB charger. I don't think bluetooth works while it's charging but I've never looked into it in detail.Build quality is just ok. All plastic and doesn't look / feel very solid. With my last Bose headset the first thing to go was the small audio jack; this one I use exclusively wireless to prevent the same problem for recurring.All in all, this is a solid product. You don't want to throw it in the hands of a kid and you don't want to forget it on lest you find it out of juice when you really need it but other than that it's fine. In my humble opinion it should really be priced around $230-$250 (it's about $300 at the moment) especially given battery life and build quality.","Reviewed in the United States September 29, 2020",AHGW4LGZS3RFVFJSB2U5XLRYTMPQ,True,2,Color: Black
R1CYTE4XXIHVEC,B0756CYWWD,"4.0 out of 5 stars Great Bluetooth Noise Canceling, Above Average Headphone, and Poor Wired Experience",K,4,"This headset is not especially isolating. They do not lie when they say world class noise cancellation because when it's off you can hear everything, but when it's on, almost nothing.The Bluetooth is actually pretty good. The headset can be paired two two devices at once. It will not mix the sound unfortunately but it will automatically play whichever device is playing sound and switch when the active one stops. You can also control pretty much every function of the headset from the app or the physical buttons.The build seems to be sturdy enough. I don't think it will snap as easily as other swivel cup type headsets.The sound quality is probably among the high end of average or the low end of HiFi. Good surround though.Just two things wrong with it. No microphone over aux and the smaller 2.5mm port in the headset is prone to disconnects in my unit. Heck the default cable that comes with it will disconnect if you plug it in firmly. For mine you have to pull it out just a little bit to get it to connect.Good aux cable experience and microphone over aux were two features I really had my hopes up for. With wired headsets in the company blood I expected more from the wired backup. At least it will pipe the audio from the aux cable to the headset with it off(and I assume/hope with a dead battery). This was a genuine worry because it won't play the aux audio while it's on unless the connection is perfect. The power off aux audio quality is not usable by default with the low power output of normal aux ports. I haven't yet tested it with an amp but I'm assuming an amplifier can drive this headset. I'll update again if that experiment fails.Update : An inline amplifier or other higher output device will drive the headphones to usable audio levels with a dead battery but the quality is severely impaired. Only recommend in an emergency.Note that the audio quality with a dead battery does not impact my ratings. This was just a fun experiment, and I know how important the powered software is for tuning this headphone. It's good to know that it will work in the worst case. What did impact my review is the shoddy connection of the aux port.","Reviewed in the United States December 10, 2019",AHVMDLU7YLB4QZEMTSAFHW5FWW4A,True,0,Color: Black
R3UDHPQWBB6P7F,B0756CYWWD,"3.0 out of 5 stars Comfortable, decent sound, but very buggy",Dipankar Mitra,3,"I did not buy these from Amazon, but directly from Bose. However, I did want to write a review as there are so many annoying bugs with this that buyer should definitely know about. Unfortunately, I could not figure out how to write a review on Bose.com so might as well submit one here.Firstly, the Pros:-I have always been a JBL guy, and have used several JBL headphones in the past. In 2020, I decided with so many conference calls from home, I needed something more comfortable. The Bose QC 35 series II delivers in this aspect. It is definitely one of the most comfortable over-the-ear headphones I have owned. Bose's sound quality is over-hyped usually, but in reality I found it to be just the same as my older JBL ones. That is not a bad thing - my JBLs sounded great, and these Bose ones sound great as well. No complaints in this department.However, the cons:-The bluetooth connectivity of this headphone is completely buggy and messed up. I certainly dont think Bose did any sort of quality assurance in this department. I bought these for about $299, and I certainly did not expect such a poor performance for 300 dollar headphones. There is no issues if you connect these headphones to just one device and stay with that device all the time. But in today's world, a pair of wireless headphones would likely be connected to two devices at the same time - the phone and the laptop. I use a iPhone 11, and a Dell laptop. These headphones go absolutely crazy when these two are connected. The first problem - it randomly starts playing music from the phone when I am connected to the laptop. It does not disturb the audio on the laptop though. I can attend a conference call happily, but then I notice that the iPhone is showing a ""now playing"" song. When the conference call ends, the phone's music starts playing and that is very annoying. However, this is still acceptable, compared to the second problem - the headphones would randomly disconnect and connect from the phone every few seconds when it is connected to the laptop. This is so annoying during conference calls that I have to manually turn off bluetooth from my phone. Every few seconds, I cannot hear my colleagues and they cannot hear me, because the headphone's voice prompt says ""iPhone disconnected"". Then in 5 seconds again, says ""iPhone connected"". Turning off the voice prompt does not solve this, as the headphone now beeps and pings when this happens. Overall, I think Bose did a really poor job with bluetooth and they should be called out for it.

R34VJ21PQPDFMY,B0756CYWWD,"5.0 out of 5 stars My second pair, hope they continue making them (preferred to QC700)",D'harans,5,"I have been using my QC35 (series 1) since 2016. I used them almost daily running (though be careful with traffic, turn down cancellation), weights (edgy music like Dead Prez and Immortal Technique, or harder rock music like Disturbed) and helping drown noise from nearby train traffic during sleep. I also travel with them.The sound signature is better IMO than the SONY XM series that gets so much love. The SONY sound warm and enveloping, while these sound, edgy and angry. Which is what I need during prolonged bouts of gut chruning exercise. I sweat like a pig and have never had any problems after getting the ear cups soaking wet. Though I do wipe them off and try to keep sweat away from the components.Given this background, I jumped at the chance to get a second pair on sale. The series 2 perform to my ears a lot like series 1. subjectively they are more comfortable (how?) perhaps my old pair have aged in the materials. So I prefer the Series 2 for sleep. I sleep on my back and dont notice them. When I flip on my side, I need a thick, soft pillow to keep them from pushing into my ear. I sleep with noise cancelling without music, though my wife has an app that plays white noise. so she is protected (almost) fully against my snoring.I am a guy and dont mind the Rose Gold color. The black is more versatile. But, if anyone doent like it, they dont have to look.I find the ear cups of the QC35 to be less 'warming' than the QC700. And the QC 700 are better than most others I have tried. The only downside to the QC35 is the noise during phone conversations. It is amplified, not attenuated. So, for those reasons we had to keep a pair of QC 700 that we tried out.So, we have two QC35, one QC700 and another set of sleep headphones.

R28A4W9B6XC2J6,B0756CYWWD,2.0 out of 5 stars Horrible sound quality. My stock car speakers sound beter than this garbage,De,2,"I had the Bose quiet comfort 15 for years. It was the best pair of headphones I've ever owned, so when they recently started to crap out after years of heavy use I decided to replace them with the QC35II. I watched a few reviews of the QC35II to be sure, all of which expressed how clear and crisp the sound quality was, with only a few minor complaints compared to other higher-priced headphones. What could go wrong?I will say a few good words before I trash these headphones. The QC35II seems to be just as comfortable as the QC15, and that's saying a lot - they are incredibly comfortable and you basically never have to take them off from a comfort standpoint. The other plus is they have a jack so you don't have to use bluetooth if you wont want to. And unlike the QC15, the QC35 doesn't need to be powered on to produce sound, only to cancel noise. They are lightweight and look nice. I don't care about the programmable buttons on the sides, the swiping for calls or whatever, or the google assistant/alexa compatibility, so I can't speak for any of those frivolous features as I'd never use them. If the sound quality were good, these would easily be 10/10 headphones, and I'd easily spend hundreds more on them. But no amount of features or comfort or whatever can make up for bad quality sound in a pair of headphones, especially at this price.I have experience with many Bose products, from 6ft tall tower speakers to the QC15. I have come to expect a good - if not great - level of quality in sound from Bose, and in general from mid-upper end products such as this. All of the Bose products I currently have or have used are from 5-10+ years ago, so I could understand perhaps with time the quality of newer products has rapidly deteriorated. But I am not sure, it is only a guess. I have not used another pair of headphones outside of the QC15s in years, so I cannot directly compare to anything more recent. For all I know the QC35IIs are the best headphones on the market right now and everything else is far worse. Who knows.I had read somewhere that the QC35II auto equalizes, and while I am not sure if that is true, it may be the problem here if it is. If it does auto equalize, I could not find a way to turn it off. Noise canceling at high, low, and off did not seem to affect the sound quality. There was no difference between bluetooth and a hardwired connection. Phones, computers, the input source did not make a difference. I tried, god I tried so hard to equalize these so they would sound good. Nothing works. The sound quality is honestly so bad that it's a more pleasant experience listening to music on my 2008 cars stock speakers.Treble comes through ok. It's not great, but it's not the worst either. It sounds as if there is some small amount of fine graininess in the highs, most noticeable on symbols and such. At the same time this fine noise also sounds as if its being masked ever so slightly in an effort to pretend it isn't there.The mids are just bad. It sounds as if it's underwater. Things just kind of blend together in a real bad way and there is nothing to do about it.And the lows. Oh gods the bass. Never would I imagine a pair of headphones costing over $50 would sound so bad. The crackling that others experience is definitely a issue, and it seems to happen at even lower volumes, but that is by no means the biggest problem here. The lows in general sound as if someone draped a damp sheet of cardboard over the sound source. It compounds on the underwater mids and slightly tinnish highs to produce an overall unpleasant experience. If the lows were even passable it might not be so intolerable, but as I said it compounds the problems with the mids and highs.There is something just muddy and muffled about the whole thing. And there is absolutely no sense of the music being around you either, it is obvious that it is emanating from a crappy speaker stuck up against either ear.I honestly can't imagine anyone liking these for any reason. The sound quality is maybe acceptable for a generic brand of $30 headphones. I am at a loss for how to fully express how great my disappointment is with the QC35II.","Reviewed in the United States October 19, 2020",AHNSAZ7NCKYVUSSJ6AYXWXMP4VSA,True,4,Color: Black
R65B03E6AX2XE,B0756CYWWD,5.0 out of 5 stars Most comfortable noise-cancelling headphones,HB,5,"BUILD QUALITY AND FIT: The build quality is excellent and I feel confident that it will last for a long time. It fits both me and my wife very well and both of us have found it to be very comfortable (better than Sony WH1000XM2). I have been using it for 3-5 hours in the office on a daily basis.SOUND: The sound is clean and crisp. If you prefer headphones with high bass, these are probably not for you.NOISE CANCELLATION: I find the noise-cancellation to be amazing! It cancels all ambient noise like noise inside airplanes or noise from AC. You will still be able to hear people talk and other random noises when noise cancellation is on and no music is playing. When music is being played at low volume and noise cancellation is on, I am unable to hear any outside noise. Noise cancellation works even if you don't pair it with any device.APPEARANCE: I am not a fan of the silver one, but the black one looks slick.CONNECTIVITY: Getting it connected with Nexus 6P was effortless. I struggled a lot to get it connected with my Windows 7 laptop which I use for work. Finally after a lot of trial and error, I was able to do it. I believe this is an issue with Windows 7 drivers. The blue tooth range is at least a good 30 feet. Switching between devices is again very easy.CONTROLS: The right ear cup has buttons for switching on/off, control volume, skips songs, and pause/continue. They are very convenient, since I don't have to locate/unlock the phone. These works very well with my phone. However skip/pause/continue doesn't work with my laptop.The right ear cup has a button for google assistant/noise cancellation control. The on/off button can also be used to switch between multiple devices.BATTERY: Battery lasts at least 20 hours as advertised.MIC: I have used it for making phone calls and it works very well.QC35 I vs QC35 II: If you already own QC35 I, I don't see much value in upgrading. If you are trying to decide which one to buy, I think the extra $20 is worth it. Even if you don't use google assistant (like me), you can program it to change the noise cancelling levels (without going through the app).BOTTOM LINE : If you are looking for a really comfortable pair of noise-cancelling headphones with clean sound, get this one! If you prefer headphones with extra bass and if comfort is not an important factor, look elsewhere.","Reviewed in the United States October 22, 2017",AE4W5CYST22BZ6PVKME33DN5JDVQ,True,25,Color: Black
R1YI9IWGY3ZR92,B0756CYWWD,5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent choice for noise-cancelling headphones,Kyle Hill,5,"These are the best headphones I've used to-date. The noise cancellation technology is very effective and makes it easy to enjoy music, movies, or podcasts without any distracting background noise, especially from things like cars or vacuums.The headphones are comfortable to wear for extended periods of time, thanks to their soft ear cushions and lightweight design. The battery life is impressive, with up to 20 hours of wireless listening or up to 40 hours with the included audio cable.One of the standout features of the QuietComfort 35 II headphones is their integration with voice assistants like Alexa. This makes it easy to control your music or access information hands-free.The sound quality is excellent, with a balanced and detailed sound signature that works well for a wide range of music genres. The headphones also offer customizable settings through the Bose Connect app, allowing you to adjust the noise cancellation levels, EQ settings, and more.Overall, the Bose QuietComfort 35 II Wireless Bluetooth Headphones are an excellent choice for anyone who wants a high-quality listening experience without any distractions. While they are on the pricier side, the build quality, comfort, and performance justify the investment. If you're looking for a top-of-the-line pair of headphones, these should definitely be on your shortlist.","Reviewed in the United States April 27, 2023",AGPQBIABJXJYHAZUADOHOGFHNCSA,True,2,Color: Rose Gold
R2F6I4XNMUPSMG,B0756CYWWD,4.0 out of 5 stars Decent but not perfect,R. S. Samet,4,"I purchased these as a spare pair since the Airpods that were gifted to me refused to stay in my ear regardless of tip used. (I generally don't get along with earbuds) That said, I have had a set of QC35 II's for about a year. First, I have hyperacusis, but my hearing is fine at lower volumes and my perception of sound quality is fine as long as it's not too loud for me. These headphones enable me to do basic things, like deal with noises in the grocery store or ride in a noisy car. The BlueTooth connectivity and range is excellent. The caller hears me well, even in a noisy server room. Comfort is excellent. Music sound quality is acceptable and they definitely don't do harsh. (They are not going to make your Beyerdynamic, Sennheiser, AKG, etc. quality wired headphones and decent electronics obsolete.) Noise cancellation is quite good, though they do give the sensation of pressure and have a background ""hiss"". The noise cancellation isn't like you've been placed in a sound proof room. I can still hear people talk to me with it at its maximum setting. Battery life is excellent and they charge quickly. Having physical buttons works well. I have hated some capacitive touch headphones I have tried. As soon as I see capacitive touch, for me it's a product best avoided as I'm always touching the wrong spot and I work in tech! Major dislikes: the announcement voice is too loud for me and cannot be adjusted, nor can the BeeeDeep when the caller hangs up, if you choose not to use the voice. Again, this beep is unnecessarily loud and cannot be adjusted! In the year I've had the one pair, I have worn out a set of ear pads, which were easy to get and replace. They do seem a bit fragile, so don't stretch the headband too much.","Reviewed in the United States December 13, 2020",AGXCD5YEMY6ROB4B3PJDSPMHPRBQ,True,0,Color: Black

I received the Sony first and used them for a couple of days off and on with one session being 2 hrs. The features of these are awesome! So easy to setup and use. The app was also easy and lots of features to adjust the headphones. The touch pad though sensitive, i got used to keeping my hand away from it except when needed and i really like the Pause feature and Vol. The noise cancellation is top notch and the best of the two. I could not hear anything outside the headphone and a muffle sound when my wife was talking to me. Sound is amazing though i thought it was a little bass heavy. My initial feeling was it was definitely a keeper! But that changed after that 2 hr session. The headphone started to feel heavy and though i am not to sensitive to the use of head gear as i ride a motorcycle and spent many many years on a US Navy Flight Deck, the headphone were getting a bit warm and uncomfortable around the ears.I received the Bose and was just as easy to set up. The app is not as feature rich as the Sony but has the basics required. Used the Bose for a 2 hr session also and though it was a bit warm also not as much as the Sony. It was not as heavy as the Sony. The sound on the Bose was not as detailed as the Sony but pretty close on all the genres of music i listen to. I also noticed that the distance between the Bluetooth source and the headphones on the Bose is not as far as the Sony but plenty of distance. The Noise Cancellation is not as good as the Sony but it did muffle most sounds around though i was able to hear the floor fan and i could talk to my wife without taking the headphones off. The controls on the Bose seem primitive compared to the Sony but it works well and easy to use.In the end, i ended up keeping the Bose as they were more comfortable to wear for extended times. If i was just looking for a headphone for short periods of use, I would definitely go with the Sony but I needed these headphones for use of extended times. The sound is solid and enjoyable and the Noise Cancellation feature is tolerable.Once i get more use and utilize more of its features, i will update.","Reviewed in the United States August 14, 2018",AFKL5PAISIZPIA6BZNX3ODJ6UMNA,True,0,Color: Black

R3C5M9L89HHK81,B0756CYWWD,5.0 out of 5 stars Bose QC35 II,Mark,5,"The last pair of headphones I purchased were the Sennheiser Momentum Series headphones 7 or 8 years ago. I had to replace the cord recently other than that they look like new and sound terrific. I decided I wanted wireless headphones for Christmas for convenience with noise cancelling as a feature. I read the reviews about the Bose 700 series and compared notes. The difference is better and best. Most say the 700 series has better noise cancellation thant the QC 35 II version. However, no one seemed convinced the difference in price was justified unless appearance and preferring swipe and tap features over buttons and switches.I really like this headset because it is comfortable, the genre of music I listen to sparkles and thumps in the right places. Headphones done right creates a hedge from all of what is bothersome. I recommend the Bose QC headphones because they have the capability of putting me in a better head space on any given day weather listening to audiobooks or streaming music, Bose has managed to provide seamless entertainment I find worthwhile during the hours and hours of being in one place because of this awful pandemic.I cannot say if this unit is better than peer competitors, but I can say if you catch them on sale or someone gives you this gift for your birthday they are plenty good enough. I almost did not get the headset because of the Bose App. I am coming from 7-8 year old corded headphones, why do I need a middle man, so to speak. No matter how glorious the product it is only as good as the app that influences or controls it. The Bose App is no reason not to make the purchase, so far so good.

R398YCTQOQPDJR,B0756CYWWD,5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing,Paula,5,"Really love these headphones. I am just a casual music listener, so I just wanted comfortable headphones with decent sound quality, and these are that! I didn't really care about noise cancellation but these are insanely noise cancelling. You can download the app and choose different levels of noise cancellation (high, low and off), I often opt for the low level. It blocks out quite a bit of noise around me while having these on even with the low level of noise cancellation. As for sound quality/volume, I think both are decent but the volume sometimes feels a bit low so i have to turn the volume up a bit to hear music. There is apparently a microphone and calling option but i never use that. I opted for the gray color as I saw a ton of reviews with the black ones coming damaged and I adore them! It comes in a case with a charging cord and a cord to make these into wired headphones. Also super comfortable, I often have issues with other headphones hurting my ears after a few hours but these don't hurt at all! Battery life is great, lasts for a good while without needing a charge. They feel hefty and good quality in your hands. Would def recommend!

R3EMVZZ36OP38O,B0756CYWWD,"5.0 out of 5 stars So nice, I bought them twice 😄",Roge213,5,"Wow! This thing AMAZING!! For years I have been resisting the urge to buy noise cancelling headphones because I thought they were just a fad. The latest gizmo. Also, Bose was pretty much the only game in town, and the price was outrageously high. Because my wife and I do our fair share of traveling, I felt it was about time to seriously reconsider my thoughts about anc headphones. After watching countless YouTube videos and reading a few reviews online about the different models of anc headphones available today, I decided to take a chance and go with the Bose Quietcomfort 35 II. I bought 2 pairs. One black (mine), and one silver (wife's). I was instantly impressed with the sound quality and the effectiveness of the noise cancelling feature. Sounds are full and balanced; nothing really overwhelming (no over the top bass). And oh so comfortable. Just make sure you adjust the headband to fit your head properly. I've worn them for 8-10 hours continually for the past few days, and they never hurt my head or ears. My wife loves her Bose headphones too, and she's very picky about everything I give her. I can vacuum the house, use power tools, make as much noise as I want, and she's no longer bothered. The pressure other reviewers feel in their ears are true for me as well. But I just yawn or do any of the usual things a person does to relieve that airline cabin pressure in the ears. Eventually my ears become acclimated and I don't feel the pressure anymore. I set the smart button on the left ear cup to control the noise cancellation level because I can call up my Google Assistant by holding down the play/pause button on the right ear cup. So I don't need two buttons for that feature. All in all, we love our new anc headphones. We use them almost everyday to listen to music, watch TV, or just to block out any annoying ambient noises. We have an upcoming trip in a couple of weeks and I can hardly wait to try them on the flight. Glad I finally got these. Almost forgot to mention this. The shipping was super fast. Ordered it on a Tuesday, and it arrived on my doorstep the very next day. That's another reason for me to love these things.

It works great for calls, other than tangling here and there and not allowing me to grab some water without loosing part of the conversation. I also have a pair of Taotronics which sound great and have long lasting battery life but a basically non-existen ANC. I got a pair of Sony WH-1000XM3/B that I found great except it developed some hissing noise on the right side the first week and I had to return them.I then decided to get the QC35-II. They look great, give me me the freedom to go arround and still hear and talk.This is what I like: Excellent noise cancelling (same as the Sony), works well on computer video calls/conferences with the Bluetooth, tells the battery level when turning on, charges super fast.What is so-so: The QC15 is lighter and more comfortable, better earcuffs.What I thought was subpar: When turning on it has a robotic anoying voice prompt (the Sony had a smooth soothing voice. Even my Taotronics have a great soothing voice too). Battery life is abismal. If I have a busy day it's gone, so about 10-12 hours even though they say 20hrs. VolumeUp/Down buttons are hard to feel when pressed, makes it confusing to use double/tripple clicks. Very few extra features especially when used with a PC, the primary use for me.Overall they are good, but I continue using my QC15 and Taotronics, both more battery and sound efficient.","Reviewed in the United States February 25, 2021",AEPYE7OXHR3YSZPRNJ7RBIXRQMSA,True,1,Color: Black

I'm very satisfied with them in that regard. The audio quality seems like an improvement as well, but not significantly.Cons: The noise cancellation doesn't seem as good as my old headphones, but it's good enough to serve my purposes when I'm trying to avoid the sounds of my noisy neighbors from inside my bedroom. But when I took a walk and listened to a podcast on my phone, it seemed like it did not block out as much noise.Also, the blue tooth connection kept cutting down briefly for a few seconds during my walk (which did not happen when I used the headphones with my phone in my room). Because of this, I'm going to use my old pair of headphones while outdoors since I did not have this problem with them.Regarding the phone app, it's a little obnoxious to have install it t in order to set up the headphones, particularly since I am mostly using them with my laptop. I also found it difficult to pair the headphones with the laptop, but it eventually worked out.I had major problems downloading the firmware via the app on my phone, although perhaps it was an issue with my phone (was isn't that great) rather than an issue with the app. Eventually, it worked, but it kept starting the download over and took forever. Another review mentioned that the firmware ruined the headphones, but that doesn't seem to be the case with the current version. The quality of the headphones doesn't seem to have changed after the firmware was installed (although I suppose it's possible that it caused the noise-cancellation to not work as well, but I have no way of knowing because the noise-cancellation seemed fine until I used the headphones outdoors yesterday).Also, the built-in microphone is pretty terrible. The description says it's ""noise-rejecting,"" but that does not appear to be the truth.","Reviewed in the United States July 6, 2020",AEECWKDD43QIOUIBQP73LRGXQ7UA,True,0,Color: Rose Gold

Evans,4,"The headphones are great, with a -1 star issue that I’ll discuss at the end. For the record, I’m not an audiophile and I can be totally happy with the sound quality of $35 headphones, so you’ll want to keep that in mind.The sound quality on these is good enough, though if I’m honest, I kind of expected...something else for $300. Crisper, maybe? I can live with it, but if it weren’t for the noise-canceling feature, I wouldn’t feel these were worth the money I’d spent. That said, the noise-canceling feature is GOLD. I live with a hard-of-hearing parent and she puts everything on BLAST. With these, I can work in peace while sitting in the same room as she watches television.The controls and buttons are straightforward and easy to access.So about that -1 star issue: getting these to work on a Windows 10 computer via Bluetooth isn’t hard, but it’s a multi-step process.First, you have to download the Bose Connect app to your mobile Android/Apple device. Why? Because this app is how you manage the headphone features and settings. (Like setting the Action button to do one thing or another.)Next, plug the headphones into your computer via the USB cable and find the updater app at btu.Bose.com. Run the updater with the headphones plugged in. Once your firmware is updated and your headphones are set up through the Bose Connect app, THEN you can go to your computer’s Bluetooth Device manager and sync up your headphones.","Reviewed in the United States April 11, 2021",AFL6LKEED6VQREJFOSU3GGLT4YLA,True,0,Color: Silver

Noise cancellation has to be awesome.Both are excellent. Super comfortable, I feel zero pressure on my glasses. I wear frameless and they are generally a bit more fragile than a full frame. With this headset there's nothing to worry about.The noise reduction is significant. As I was testing them out for the first time watching a Netflix show a parade of cars and vans were filling up my apartment parking lot giving the 2020 students in the area a Covid-19 style parade to celebrate.

I couldn't hear the marching band at all. During quiet times in my own show I could only just barely hear the characters on the show he was watching speak.

R2ST8FL3U2L29D,B0756CYWWD,5.0 out of 5 stars Bose nailed it!,Dwight Ball,5,"For the past year anytime I browsed a store that had a display of headphones I camped out and listened trying to compare and decide if I wanted to take the plunge. Based on my trials I bought some Cowin 7, then 9 pro headphones. I realized I would listen for a while then go back to my home system because my music just sounded flat. They are both good phones for the money, but they lust didn't have the true richness of sound experience that comes from a balance of mid and hi and low. Seems manufacturers either lean toward investing their R&D into giving you brain-rattling bass, I even saw one ad that claimed your whole body would resonate with their headphones. Others simply don't have enough punch on the bass when you're in the car, the office or walking. I almost gave up thinking nothing really beats the spatial experience of a well-balanced hi-end system.A couple weeks ago I was in Costco and they had the Bose QC35 II's on display. I wasn't in a hurry to get samples so I put them on. Wow! I was surprised. The richness of sound across the whole spectrum was obvious. But it was probably too good to be true because I had been hoping to use ANC for my office. What would they sound like with noise canceling on? I pushed the button on the side, ""Noise Cancellation Off"" the voice said. Wait a minute. You mean I was hearing that bass, and the mids, and the treble with ANC on? If you stand still and listen on a busy day in a Costco you will realize just how noisy the AC and the crowds are. I cycled through ANC and heard very little difference. They really have nailed it. Very impressive. I was hooked. My pair arrived this week and I can't get enough of them. I wear them in the car, at home, in the office, listening to classical, rock, 60's... incredible the way it brings alive the subtle richness of a Grieg Concerto, or wild range of Santana or the smooth richness of the Commodores.

Some things to know before you buy:The bad:- When it connects/disconnects from any device, it speaks LOUDLY with the ""smart"" announcer voice overtop of whatever you're doing, completely drowning everything else out. This is particularly irritating if you're using it on your phone, and it repeatedly connects/disconnects from your laptop due to proximity.- Range isn't great, as one would expect from bluetooth.- When you use these for any situation where the mic is on (calls, zoom, etc.), the sound quality of what you hear cuts to absolute crap. This is a function of bluetooth itself (sending and receiving at the same time), rather than the headset, but keep that in mind if you're expecting beautiful quality in your calls. That said, if you use a different mic for your calls (like the one on your laptop or webcam), you will maintain the higher-quality sound in the headset (since the headset mic is off), so keep that in mind as a good option for hearing your zoom calls more clearly!The good:- Noise cancelling is pretty good for the price!- Comfortable enough to wear for 8+ hours per day, even if your head requires US extra-large hats!- Build quality seems solid enough under heavy use.","Reviewed in the United States July 10, 2021",AHX3ILVYBDRRUYZXE4OBEQTD3E5A,True,0,Color: Silver

I was expecting something more noticeable by buying a Bose product. After seeing their products in stores and all the hype, I wanted a GOOD quality headphone for listening to music (from modern pop to classical). What I hears was the same sound i get out of any normal headphone from Walmart. Now the headphones DO say they offer customization through using the app on your phone, since I using them mostly listening to music from my laptop means NONE of those features are available for ANY customization through the headphones. All of the 'features' offered are only offered using them using bluetooth, and batteries, NOT when you use them using the audio cable connection. So you can use them.. charge them.. use them.. But if you want to just plug them in using the audio cable, you may as well just buy to $10 paid of headphones from Walmart.I was very disappointed not hearing any audio improvement when spending $278.85 on a pair of headphones.I cannot say if they block outside noise, if the noise cancellation is any good, again, nothing works while using them plugged in, even if you turn the power on.As I haven't found how to use them using the computer bluetooth, even though my computer recognizes and connects with bluetooth, no sound will come through them, maybe that's my fault, or maybe its like other headphones I have had where bluetooth use through a computer is not possible, only through devices such as phones, ipods, and so on. So you are forced to use the audio cable and hence, no features.One last thing I don't like, and maybe its an industry standard internationally, is that Bose is using a 2.5mm jack vs. the standard 3.5mm audio jack. While it comes with one audio cable 2.5mm to 2.5mm, it means if you have any other audio cables (I had paid extra for higher quality ones to prevent sound loss/distortion), none of them will work with these headphone unless you buy a 2.5 to 3.5mm audio jack adapter.If I were to do this again, I would probably opt to try a Beats pair, as I have heard they offer great sound quality as well; but I would not recommend these for anyone trying to spend a bit of extra $$ and expecting an improvement in sound quality.Side note, the original source of your audio obviously affects sound quality. You cant make a poor quality audio improve dramatically just by buying a good headphone; I have used high quality audio sources for my music which sound great on my speakers, just not so much in the headphones.Hope this has helped anyone struggling with what to pick the way I was, maybe it will apply to you, maybe not; just trying to offer a fair review on my experience.","Reviewed in the United States August 22, 2020",AECC3WM3XRMMHS4G45CYOTKVUGTQ,True,1,Color: Black
R3Q7C6DSRCROJO,B0756CYWWD,5.0 out of 5 stars Worth EVERY penny! Seriously.,janel e young,5,"Never did I ever think I would spend so much money on headphones. I also always previously though people looked goofy and/or pretentious with their enormous headphones. My earbuds are so sleek and convenient. Let me tell you, I was wrong.Bought this to go on a weekend trip that required me to share a room with a large friend who snores terribly (but swears she doesn’t). Even on the plane, I knew I had made a great purchase but they blocked out the snoring probably 95%. What came through was very faint, almost like a very, very distant white noise machine (of what sound or why you’d want it, who knows). I am very sensitive to noise and a light sleeper in general so these headphones were just a remarkable experience when first turning them on.I am not on the autism spectrum but, man, I can definitely see why individuals with certain sensitivities and degrees on that spectrum could benefit from wearing noise cancelling headphones. I feel like I’m on my own world where hardly anyone or anything can bug me. I rarely want to take them off when I get to work in the morning!I now wear these every day on my 2.5 mi walking commute to work across DC. I listen to podcasts and the low noise cancelling feature is great for traffic bc it cancels out most of the blaring sirens, jake breaks and car horns but still allows you to hear them enough to be aware of your surroundings. You can also hear voices enough to tell if someone is talking to you or asking for directions. I just press pause to listen and then play to continue.My only (very small) complaint is that unless you sleep on your back, they are not very comfortable to sleep with. I have pretty noisy upstairs and next door neighbors. Just a poorly constructed, small condo building with thin walls and objectively *awful* squeaky floorboards. The headphones cancel all that out but due to their bulkiness, it is uncomfortable to have them pressing against your ear/head when on your side or stomach. This is the only way I can sleep so I feel like I’m trading one thing for another in order to sleep well. Still, I’ll take this over that!Thanks Bose!!!","Reviewed in the United States December 11, 2018",AGIY2CL6HCCOSVOMDVEDIUOHD4MA,True,6,Color: Silver
R1D6AFLAUH1IKB,B0756CYWWD,4.0 out of 5 stars They’re cool I guess,Yardley Rosas,4,"For the price I was low key expecting more so I don’t know if they’re worth the cost but I definitely don’t regret getting them. They are not bad at all, much better than the airpods in terms of sound quality and noise cancellation, which is all I could compare it to. I only have a few problems with it that agitate me but don’t necessarily make me hate the product.The most annoying thing I think is the range for bluetooth. If I am going to the kitchen or to my patio (10-20ft tops from my room) instead of disconnecting from my phone, the sound just gets really distorted. Another kind of annoying thing is that sometimes at night I’ll listen to asmr and if what you’re listening to is quiet, random beeps play every once in a while and it’s like jarring compared to the softness of what I’m listening to. Lastly is that it automatically connects to anything you connect it to. For example, if I have them on and my roommate turns on the tv in the living room, it will connect to the tv and mute it so I have to go into the app and disconnect which is whatever but gets super annoying. It got to the point where I just unpaired it from the tv and repair if I want to use them.Other than those things though I don’t have a problem with them at all they’re actually kind of amazing. Soft ear things, super light, and seems pretty durable.","Reviewed in the United States March 14, 2021",AHS6VSQTRWHC6VYIDYQHUDDUMOJA,True,0,Color: Silver

REEXHGPGJMEMI,B0756CYWWD,"2.0 out of 5 stars Bose QuietComfort 35 Series II – Bose SoundLink II – Microsoft Surface, FAIL in an open office",VirtualWatts,2,"I was looking for a pair of headphones to help me with video/VOIP calls in a noisy office environment as an upgrade to my Jabra 370 – I tried Bose QuietComfort 35 Series II – Bose SoundLink II – Microsoft Surface and all three failed.Bose QC35 best sound qualitySurface failed to work with iPhone X and iPad ProSoundlink isn’t noise cancellingAll three have microphones that amplify ALL VOICES IN THE ROOM – failTurns out the Jabra 370 really is the best for office communications, but not for taming noisy office.Our company just moved to a new open office design. That means no walls, no offices, all open space with desks, work stations and huddle areas. I had an office until we moved and was going from speakerphone to headphones. We are a global company thus video conferencing and VOIP con calls are constant on Zoom, Skype, WebEx etc.I already have a Bluetooth wireless headset Jabra 370, it is “on the ear” with a boom microphone, I thought an “around the ear” would help better with the new noisy office. The Jabra 370 uses a USB transmitter and is pretty much tied to desktops/laptops.Now, about my special circumstances, I have a hearing disability and wear a hearing aid and Cochlear Implant. For this review what that means is that I hear from things that sit on my ear rather then inside my ear and because I already have the hearing aids cannot wear an ear bud arrangement. I am an IT professional.This review is of all three subject headsets:1) Noise Cancellation for Other Party – (FAIL) that is, when on a call what does the other side hear? And here all three failed, on calls the other parties could hear voices from all across the office because the microphone arrays would pick up every voice in the room. For the QC35 weirdly it was only when I was speaking – deathly silent when I wasn’t, but the moment I began to speak all the other voices in the room came through loud and clear, very distracting to the folks on other end of the call, at one point they could hear a conversation 35 feet away very clearly that I couldn't hear because of the headset2) Noise Cancellation for Wearer– The Soundlink is not noise cancelling (I thought all Bose were) and therefore, it cannot work in a noisy open office environment, the Bose QC35 did the best job of noise cancellation, the Surface okayBut about noise cancellation – Bose is made for like a plane non-voice noisy environment, in an open office where the “noise” is other people talking on phones or in groups, the Bose actually makes the problem WORSE by amplifying surrounding voices3) Call Quality – all three had good call quality on Win10 bluetooth, but the Surface had terrible quality for other party on the iPhone X and iPad, the other end and con calls could not hear me like I was in a tunnel4) Pairing - All three headsets paired easily with my Win10 Lenovo corporate laptop, Win10 Surface Book 2 personal laptop, iPad Pro and iPhone X5) No boom microphone – all three use a microphone array in the ear cup rather than boom microphone, my voice was clear on all three, but other side said QC35 was best soundBut note other voices are picked up as well6) Surround the ear – all three styles are designed to fit around the ear entirely instead of on or in the ear, I was worried about discomfort based upon other reviews and the Surface has small ear cups, but all fit well over my (somewhat) oversized Obama type ears. The Bose were the most comfortable, in a warm office I can tell the Surface would have a sweat issue7) Sound clarity – all three had very good voice sound clarity, but the Bose QC35 did so with less volume turned up, volume of 8 – 10 for others while volume of 5 on Bose QC35 to hear the same thing8) Interoperability – all three operated fine on all manner of video, voip, UCaaS and web calls9) Multi-device – in theory all three are supposed to connect to both phone and computer for dual inputs, I guess to hear music and then take a call or conversation, in reality that is horrible because my VOIP calls were constantly interrupted by the alerts and messages from my phone, the headset was constantly switching back and forth, and once, my iPhone randomly began playing music during a VOIP con call10) Digital Aid/Cochlear – all three work fine with digital hearing and BTE hearing aids, and Advanced Bionics Cochlear implant11) Sound Quality – my focus was on voice clarity not music, all three have excellent sound quality, The QC35 the best, then the Surface and then the Soundlink, the volume on the QC35 did not have to go as high to get the same results as the other two","Reviewed in the United States February 4, 2019",AGQJUPHOYSRWOZFTRNWUUCQ6TY4Q,True,4,Color: Black
RKAB2RDVHYYCE,B0756CYWWD,5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent noise cancelation.,Timothy Parker,5,"I bought these specifically for the noise cancellation and not primarily as a set of bluetooth headphones. I chose the QC35II over the 700 version because the QC35II is a bit lighter-weight and reportedly more comfortable, but I did not verify that by trying both. Since I could be wearing these for extended periods, comfort was an important consideration. They are very comfortable, though at times I must adjust the positioning. The noise cancellation is outstanding. There is a very small background hiss produced by the headphones that might be a slight annoyance by some, and I would prefer it to be absent, but I can live with it. With noise cancellation on high, most external sounds are blocked or greatly diminished. This includes traffic noise, lawn mowers, fan noise, microwave oven noise, just about everything. I've even tried these riding in a car on the freeway and was astounded by how much it reduced the usual car noise. Living in the city suburbs, I often even use these while outside in the backyard, with the usual noise of the city suddenly disappearing. At times I have experimented with reducing the noise cancellation level to low or off, and I was startled by the amount of environmental noise I suddenly heard. But, turning on full noise cancellation filtered all of that out. It makes me realize how noisy our everyday environment is and how much more I might prefer living at a quiet country location. So, yeah, these are really great. The button controls might be a bit more difficult to locate and use than the touch-sensitive controls in the 700, but it's easy enough. The QC35II has voice prompts which becomes very annoying at times. I've used the app to turn them off. I highly recommend these noise cancelling headphones. It might be worthwhile to try both versions in a store to see which you would like best, but I'm sure both are great choices.","Reviewed in the United States April 22, 2020",AHUEHZ26MDJNOEUDDM7WDBV6W6QQ,True,1,Color: Black
R47X1PKQCOKLY,B0756CYWWD,5.0 out of 5 stars What kind of idiot would pay $300 dollars for headphones? Me.,Inna Tkatch,5,"Back when I used to spend my days fumbling with earbud wires, I wondered ""What kind of idiot would pay $300 dollars for headphones, when you can hear your sounds perfectly fine for less than $10?"". Even as these products rose more and more to popularity, I scoffed and resisted.Those days are long gone. After I borrowed them from my friend for a day and tried them myself, I knew why. After getting them, these quickly became a non-negotiable part of my life. I use them to:- take and receive meetings- freely go pee, refill coffee, and wash my dishes while listening to a meeting- go on runs while listening to music- ignore noisy people around me- get myself into a state of focus- calm my anxiety on airplanes- show people I am not interested to talk to them- as a fashion statementSeriously, I wear these so much I think I am developing a bald spot. Maybe that's why all the engineers are bald. The sound quality is superb, and so is the bluetooth range and connectivity. I have since tried the Sony's, Dolby dimensions, the newer model of these, but these are the best one. I have bought a pair for my whole family, and replaced my old pair when it got old without a second thought. One time, I tried my friend's airpods and almost threw up at the sound quality. Not to mention, with this size, they are much harder to lose.These are my favorite product of the last several years (this, and the divacup) and I would wholeheartedly recommend!","Reviewed in the United States June 15, 2021",AHERROBAS3BWSZMIM6IGFCLCKAGQ,True,3,Color: Black

The app is easy to use and it gives you an equalizer which is also easy to use. I’m not going to say that they sound better than beats or other more expensive brands but it may be very hard to mark a real difference, the sound quality is just great. The battery life is as advertised, and also as advertise, after an intense work out you can just wash them under the faucet and they are good to go. I totally LOVE how they fit, they stay in place and I can barely feel I’m wearing them. Only con is that they do not have sound cancelling, but they do have a mode for hearing around you, when this mode not on, I feel they do a good job even without the technology, just don’t expect them to give you that real sound cancelling. In summary, if you are looking for a great pair of wireless headphones and you don’t care about sound cancelling these are a great deal for the buck.","Reviewed in the United States June 12, 2024",AFZBVXDFNBBLM76QON6IQDK4YADQ,True,4,Color: Black
R1QO85BFKRDJTN,B0BQPW9R9H,"5.0 out of 5 stars Really good for price range, but there's a better option",Joe,5,"I was looking for new earphones specifically for fitness with the main usage test being running. I wanted to test across several price points to see which would be most worth the money. I've only had cheap running earphones before (though I have nicer cans that I use to listen with in other scenarios and some nice wired in ears for when I perform live). I don't really care about noise cancelling. My primary criteria were about comfort (and if it can stay in my ear while running), and the sound quality vs price (how much marginal return do I get per dollar). I ended up picking a premium pair because you can really notice how much more digital/fake the audio sounds when testing side by side, the lower down in price you go.(note: a lot of what I put were just notes I was jotting down while testing them. I try to do a more succinct summary in the first line of each option, and then it gets more rambly/random after that)In the running:Sony WF-1000XM4 $189.00 | Beats Fit Pro - $179 | Power Beats Pro - $179 | Jabra Elite 4 Active - $89 | JBL Endurance Peak 3 - $89.95 | Soundcore Sport X10 - $69.99 | JLab JBuds Air Sport - $69.88 | Golrex $29.99 | BMani T16 $39.99Here are my thoughts:Power Beats Pro - $179 (149) - My winner overallSounds great. It is not the best sound I've heard in earphones, but doesn't seem to lack anything. Has good thumpy bass, presence in the mids, and good clarity up high. Nothing to complain about the sound.Big/heavy case (doesn't matter that much, but I do take these on big hikes so smaller case would have been nicer)I think ultimately will be more comfortable for long use than the Fit pro. The stock medium tips fit fine, unlike the fit pro for some reason.Sounds essentially the exact same as the fit pro which makes senseBeats Fit Pro - $179I wanted this to be my favorite. It's light, small, has fun color options, and sounds great. But it ultimately was just not comfortable enough to leave in my ears for longer than 45 minutes. This would vary from person to person obviously.Pretty comfortable, but had to switch to the small eartips (only earbuds I had to switch from the medium/stock tips). Stays in the ears well, but I think that the whole thing being in there will get uncomfortable pushing my ears after a while. Really little case which is nice.Really great clarity, feels perfectCan't find any eq in the app, but I didn't feel the need to adjust any eq settings either, every band/frequency was very satisfying, so that's kind of nice not having to set it myselfSony WF-1000XM4 $189.00I believe this has a slightly fuller sound quality to it. Can't really pinpoint how or why, but seems to be the most superior sound quality of all of them. I thought it might be better bass but that's not it. I can't pick a part any individual component that seem superior, it just has an overall fuller soundThere just doesn't seem to be any way that these are going to stay in during a run. Would be great for any non-exercise application, but just wasn't what I was looking for. I would choose these if I were looking for just walk around town kind of earbuds.Jabra Elite 4 Active - $89Great clarity and bass out of the box. I am the kind of guy who can only really tell sound differences when a/b testing it. If I only listened to these earbuds, I would have been fully satisfied with the sound quality, the comfort, and the security. It's only because I tested it next to the premium models above that I decided not to go with this. But if this is your budget range, these are definitely the winners.Excessively comfortable, like the most comfortable of any of the earbuds (premiums included), and feel like they will stay in on a run even though they don't have any sort of little hook like the soundcore or powerbeats, or over ear hook like the others. Definitely the best ergonomics. Would take this over the JBL endurance or any other in the sub $150 price range.Soundcore Sport X10 - $69.99more satisfying for non edm music than the other options down below. Better separation for instruments and vocals.Compared against JLabs with blue tips in, the bass is more comparable. Soundcore keeps more clarity than on higher end (albeit a little tinny sounding), than JLabsBass is definitely much better than JLabs. It does feel a bit more muddy because of the heavier bass, there may have been better vocal clarity with JLabsEverything else seems fineANC is decentsmall profile is light, really comfortable and stays in the earsJLab JBuds Air Sport - $69.88bigger profile, slightly less comfortable than the Soundcore. Bass is lacking out of the box. There's better mid and high clarity on these than the soundcore.Bass improves a noticeable amount by switching to blue tips, but you lose some clarity higher upbass feels punchier in edm in these than x10These are definitely more satisfying for thumpy edm music than the x10The sound quality just feels lacking in depth, no matter which eq setting you choose.Has a connected usb charger on the case as a charger (rather than a separate chord to plug into both charger and power), which I don't think I likeJBL Endurance Peak 3 - $89.95Clear vocals and instruments in mids and highs. Slightly more clear and crisp than the soundcoreNice bass as well, (slightly worse bass than soundcore), less satisfying than the sound core on lyrical song but actually has punchier bass on edmPlenty loud (other reviews saying they don't get loud)The equalizer app gives lots of controlThis bass is also superior once equalized. So both bass and instrumental/vocals have more clarity. After messing with eq, is better than soundcore.This sounded perfectly fine until compared with higher tier, then when a/b compared it sounded a bit more fake, a bit more digital, definitely enough to notice a differenceGolrex $29.99It is okay sound, probably the best in this price range. If you just want something cheap that will give you sound, these are fine. If you care about sound quality even a little bit, it's worth it to get a better headset.There is no clarity at any frequency, just a decent amount of noise.Has an attempted cheap premium look with led interfaces.BMani T16 $39.99Sounds way below average, worse than the golrex.Really similar packaging and look to the golrex, so they're either just copying each other or made by the same people","Reviewed in the United States August 14, 2023",AFSRAJU6KF7ZSMZHCEC3IM34FTLA,True,412,Color: Black

R342PXQF8Q8JSD,B0BQPW9R9H,3.0 out of 5 stars Doesn't fall out,Arnel,3,"I have had mine for over a year now. I buy a new bluetooth earpiece every year, if they last that long. I have purchased over 7 different styles and brands and these have been the most durable. My main purpose for these are for talking on the phone while working and driving. Here is what I found.The good:- Good battery life. I think I only got low a couple times. I only use one at a time, so I just pop the other one in.- Very durable. I have dropped them quite a few times while pulling them out of my pocket. They get caught on my keys because of the magnet on them.- They stay in my ear very well. Unlike the earbuds, these don't fall out.- Like all earpieces, you have to get use to having them in your ear. However, it wasn't that bad.- With the JBL app, you can tune the sound of them. They sounded pretty good, and as an ex-DJ, I love listening to music. The bass is really good and the mids and highs are pretty clear. A lot of the sound quality also depends on what device you have them hooked to.- The charging case is really handy to keep your these charged.- I didn't use them a lot to block out ambient sound. However, the times I did, they seemed to work very well, as long as you hold them tight to your ear.- You can pair multiple devices to them.- To answer a call, you tap the side once. To hang up, you tap twice. I have not accidentally hung up on anyone due to adjusting the earpiece while on a call, which happens with other earpieces.- Mic is really clear and I have never had anyone tell me there if too much background noise.The bad:- Although you can pair multiple devices to them, the only way to get them to pair with one of the other devices, such as going from one phone to another, you have to turn the current phones bluetooth off so the JBL units will look for a different one. So, if you have it connected to one phone, but the other phone rings, you will have to go through that process to allow the ringing phone to connect.- The charging case is pretty smooth. It can be hard to handle and/or open the lid.- If you have a deep ear, these earpieces will not form a good seal. This makes it hard to block out ambient noise.- The white ones make it look like you are wearing a hearing aid. If I were to buy new ones, I would get colored ones.- You are not able to change the volume on these. You will have to change the volume with your device.- When calls come in, it will not tell you who is calling or what number is calling. So, you will have to look at the phone to see if you should answer it.I have used iPods, Beats, Bose, Sennheiser, etc... I find these to be very nice and competes well with all the other top brands. For the purpose of using it as a handsfree way to talk on the phone, I would recommend earpieces designed more for talking on the phone than for listening to music, such as these JBL units. As for overall sound quality, I liked them. With the free JBL app, you can tune these to your comfort. However, good sound is a personal preference. Everyone hears tones differently.","Reviewed in the United States April 17, 2024",AEKVOSBM3BJSP4VXJWWV2FUIAKHA,True,23,Color: White

Just listening to YouTube bumper music through these JBL Peak 3 earbuds, I get the sensation something is rattling loose in my skull. So, bass response is all there. Seriously, you can feel it.I bought this model of earbuds because they have ambient sound, which is adjustable with an app you can download from the play store. Higher ambient sound comes at a price, however. Apparently the noise cancelling feature does not affect a small condenser microphone with the gain turned up. There is a noticeable hiss. I rate this feature a 3.Comfort. With the proper size eartips, these earbuds feel a little heavy, but no more than the earpieces of a pair of industrial work glasses. Secureness is a 5, Comfort is a 4.The touch controls are s-e-n-s-i-t-i-v-e. My hair stylist is a cutie, says she likes longer hair on older guys so--duh! If I go to flick my hair off my ears with my fingers, I'm bumping the control buttons. Not sure if it's me or if it's overly sensitive touch controls. It happens every time, though.Oh. One cool feature. There is a magnetic tip on each ear hook that ""snaps"" to the base of the earbud, shutting off the earbud! Very cool feature! I can carry a single earbud in my pocket and leave the rather bulky charging case at home or in the car.Sound reproduction.

Traditional earbuds do not stay in my ears, so I have to get something with a hook.I saw these were comparable to my existing PowerBeats Pro, which were randomly disconnecting from my Mac in the middle of calls despite having battery left. So I figured I'd give it a shot. Honestly? Not too impressed. Here's the numbered ""executive summary"":1. Magnetic clasp/sensor on ear hook makes it difficult to put on2. Each ear may occasionally go out-of-sync during calls, so I'm hearing a faint ""godly echo"" of the person I'm listening to3. No tactile controls; each earpiece has a single ""touchable"" area, which can be inadvertently triggered while putting the earpiece on (see the first point)4. Single-device pairingBy contrast, the PowerBeats Pro I have uses an IR sensor instead of a magnet, and has both volume and an aux button on each earpiece. I've experienced no sync issues when it works properly. I understand there's an enormous price difference between the two, and Apple owns the fancier one (which likely means certain critical things like the IR sensor are patented) but for those who are looking to switch, just don't. Stick with what you have. And for those who can shell out more, do it.","Reviewed in the United States June 30, 2024",AEXV3EWLFOSJYR34FWJO22CFHDGA,True,0,Color: Black
R31QBP12TH6KO6,B0BQPW9R9H,4.0 out of 5 stars Stay secure when exercising.,Lizbeth Monson,4,"I ride my bicycle an average of 75 miles a week. After several months and hundreds of miles these buds have always felt secure and have never felt like they were going to fall off. However, even using the equalizer ap the sound quality is not the best. They sound a little tinny. The JBL Tune 125 TWS have a richer, fuller sound quality and much better noise cancelling. However, they would not stay secure in my ears and fell out several times.In my opinion, the ability to have a phone conversation and the security of the ear buds staying in my ears is well worth the trade off in sound quality. They also provide enough sound volume to comfortably hear while riding while still being able to hear my surroundings. With a simple tap, I can turn on ambient noise and have a face-to-face conversation without turning down the music or removing the ear buds.If you are wanting superior sound and don't care about hearing what is going on around you, look at the JBL Tune 125 TWS. For riding my bicycle on busy roads, and across busy intersections when riding the trails, the JBL Endurance Peak 3 is the best choice for me.I would definitely purchase these ear buds again.","Reviewed in the United States March 28, 2024",AHCIGTMYSZOZKE4WGLHRT5GYAAXA,True,10,Color: Black

I’ve gone through so many headphones running and pouring sweat into them, I’m curious how these will hold up. Before I committed to these I used the wired JBL headphones and I loved them so much I bought two pairs (I still have the second pair).The look and feel good… very high quality. The sound is, well, these are JBL. So you know the sound is proper. Crisp. Nice. Top notch. As expected, so they are.I’ve yet run with them, but if them withstand my sweat downpour and stand the test of at least half a year, I’ll let you know.But from what I can tell, these are awesome.By the way, for the runners (and anyone else for that matter), I have a lil belt pouch thing (not quite a fanny pack but similar) and it holds the case well so don’t worry about that aspect.As it stands, these are awesome. If they die from sweat and normal wear, I’ll let you know asap.Get them tho!","Reviewed in the United States March 8, 2024",AFSFPANX6QW5VK7Y7RS7CCWEI62Q,True,7,Color: Black

These are super comfortable for long periods and stay set in the ear during running, gym workouts, walking, at the office, etc. I have had no problem with recharging in the case. The earpiece that goes over the ear is kind of spring loaded and I love that they automatically turn on when they are opened to be put on the ear. They also spring back and automatically turn off when you take them off. There is a low power magnet that connects the ear ring to the base to turn them off. You might need to close them a bit manually to get the off connection to set but that's no big deal. The sound is very good, they connect quickly to my phone, battery life is as advertised, and the app works well with some settings that some may find useful. I did notice that my pair has 20 or so preset equalizer settings within the app but my wife's set doesn't show the extra presets when she is in the app on her phone. Overall I've been super happy with these headphones. I initially bought one set for the gym. Bought a second set for the office, and a third set for my wife. Wife is a non-tech person and she's had no issues using these on a day-to-day basis.

I recently lost the right earbuds. So i got these. The Peak3 are smaller than the Peak2. They fit fine which says alot. They link to the app and have a cool ""ambient aware"" option which heightens distant sounds. The music audio is perfect for me.I like that they are smaller and more sleek. And getting started took like 5 min. Easy peasy.The only issue I have is the case. It's too slippery. I have huge hands and I work with them daily. So they're dry at times. The Peak2 case had a button to open it. But the Peak 3 case is just lift up. And there's not really any tab or lip to manipulate the lid. I've popped the case out of my hands 4x already (in 2 days).

For listening to music, they are not loud... 7mm drivers I think. I have some Boltunes with 10mm drivers that sound fuller top to bottom and have slightly more volume but fall short comparatively in the call quality and noise cancelling department. Granted the Boltunes have no adjustments via an app and you just use as is and the sennheisers need you to configure them in the app to get it dialed in for sound quality. This severely degrades the battery life. The inexpensive Boltunes (under $40) last longer too.The senn App is OK... Better than nothing but it is also limited in features. I recommend dialing in the audio shape as thr out of the box eq is weak and thin. You can improve this pretty easily with some shaping. This app allows you to change the left and right tap feature actions which is nice. I didn't care for the default actions but you can fix that.The sennheisers are way more comfortable in ear... But are slightly bulky. Due to the plastic housing, they are lightweight, but still pro grade feeling. I used them on a flight a couple weeks ago and they did great to cancel the plane noise and I could hear the music just fine... Just not super loud... Slightly quieter than the max volume I'd prefer to have. That stated, I feel the same way about bose's products as well. Excellent audio quality but volume is sacrificed.One annoying thing is not being able to have multipoint connectivity so if you're connected to your phone and get an MS Teams call on your computer, you need to manually disconnect Bluetooth on your phone then connect to the Bluetooth on your computer. You can't just simply switch while being connected to both. (only one at a time). This is supposedly fixed in the new model but battery life didn't improve. Not sure it's worth the money to go to the TW3 yet.All in all, if you need a high quality noise cancelling earbuds that you can actually use on business calls without sounding like an amateur, this may be a great option for you if you don't go the Sony route. Definitely do your research before spending money. Things will change in a year as more demand for better features come about with more seasoned users and improved technology.

R3BKZ8P5YBL9JJ,B084ZLF1TH,2.0 out of 5 stars Inferior To The Prior Model,Non Sequitur Snowman,2,"For a quick TL;DR, the previous model outperforms these in every way, in my experience. It's possible I have a defective pair though, but that wouldn't impact range, battery life and interference, so buyer beware.I'm coming from a pair of CX Plus TW earbuds which were my first pair. I was never big on wireless audio, but for work and for casual listening it was the better bet. I bought the CX Plus TW's hesitantly expecting the experience to be miserable, and to my surprise they weren't. I started using them at home over my normal higher end headphones just to save my ears the pressure. Sadly, a week ago, one side's speaker died after just under 2 years.I say this because the Momentum TW 2's ended up being that exact miserable experience I was expecting when initially purchasing my first pair of wireless earbuds.The first time I charged them, the case's light went green and I popped them in. They lasted maybe 3 hours. I was already worried, but I thought maybe it was a false positive or I did something wrong. I charge overnight, go into work, and before I get a chance to test the battery life I realize that apparently, from reviews, the initial firmware on these things are hot garbage.To update them, you need to use the app. My phone is on Android 7, the App requires android 8. I can't update. I luckily borrow a co-workers phone, install the app, sync up, download the firmware and after an HOUR of updating I try them again. They work significantly better after that and I heave a sigh of relief thinking that hopefully I won't have to try and return them.Sadly, no. I'm still having issues and even AFTER patching the firmware, the signal cuts out abruptly with any slight thing. Sometimes I stretch with my hands above my head, and my arm covers part of my ear, the audio cuts out. Sometimes I lean on my palm, the audio cuts out. Sometimes I won't even do anything, standing still, and it cuts out. No matter the adapter, or device, less than five feet away.I went back to my old pair and tested to see if I'm being overly critical, they WILL cut out if I cup both hands over both earbuds and intentionally try to block the signal, but not accidentally like these new ones do.It is a very jarring experience to have audio cut out periodically, maybe every other minute. I code to music, and it's flow-shattering to have that happen constantly and distract you. This pair has to be defective, otherwise some major cost-saving measures must have been made, in spite of his model being more expensive.For what it's worth, after the firmware update (possibly not because of it though), the battery life does seem more respectable, but about just on par if a bit below the old ones.The noise canceling is also less effective.If you choose to go with this brand, avoid this model.","Reviewed in the United States October 28, 2022",AHRXICQSS5BWSJUYGYGJSRSWEX7A,True,2,

The buds are perfect in terms of design and the case is super premium. They don’t fall out and they are super light and comfortable. The sound is typical sennheiser. Not my cup of tea. The treble is little tame and it’s good in that it’s not fatiguing to listen to for a long time but the problem is that it lacks subbass. I use earbuds predominantly for the gym to get myself hyped and I want good deep voluminous bass. This earbud has a lot of midbass but it doesn’t get very deep in hertz. The vocals are very natural and the rest of the sound is pleasant to the ears. But if you want something that is bumping and blows you away in bass this ain’t the best option.,"Reviewed in the United States November 12, 2022",AF5PTQQI2YY4RYPVYGIKEBHN6QHQ,True,3,

They are just plain looking headphones, the black ones I got just look normal and not bright and flashy with designs just standard black headphones. They do clamp tight to your head, my ears hurt after a couple of hours of use but I use them for work where I have to bend down and pivot a lot and they don’t budge an inch so they are awesome for that. The ratchet that it uses to adjust the headphones seems like it might break easily so be careful if you adjust them just be gentle. The sound is really nice I didn’t know what to expect. The range is also pretty good as well since I don’t keep my phone in my pocket to make sure it doesn’t get damaged I put it near where I work so that’s a major plus. The bass is also good too, I’ve never had a pair of Bluetooth headphones before but the sound and volume is great. Type C charging is standard and the battery life is excellent. The buttons for volume up is fine but volume down is a little hard for me to find without a distinct nub so sometimes I end up turning them off on accident. The headphones also tell you the battery life when you turn them on and give a low battery warning as well. Seeking tracks will give you a chime to let you know it is seeking which I’ve grown to like as a feature. I haven’t tried using the mic with Siri or anything like that. It activated on accident once but never again.

These are pretty amazing. Comfortable, don't hurt and aren't tight, the sound is amazing. Plus the volume control is very easy, just press up or down, like a phone's volume button. The battery life is also crazy. Sometimes I accidentally leave them on, because your supposed to power them off. It still stayed at 70% when I used them again.

Sony doesn't need to use gimmicks such as bass boost or weights in the ear cups to give you incredible sound in a small package. Additionally, while they do lack a bit of that premium feel compared to my mainstay Sennheiser HS280 Pros, they have so far shown themselves to handle well on multiple flights per month since purchase. The ear cups are a bit small for my ears (which are themselves small) but that also doesn't detract.Where these headphones lack is the mic sensitivity. The mic on these is very sensitive and are prone to clipping very easily. Early on, I tried using these for phone calls with clients and employees and I've gotten feedback that there is a lot of clipping. I also don't really like that they pipe in a bit of mic into the audio stream when the application you are using makes use of the mic. I so far found no intuitive way to lower the mic sensitivity.Finally, while the battery life on these is bonkers (I've so far gone a month without charging), when you do charge you can't use them. And if you are using them, you can't charge. You have turn off the headphones to charge which kinda sucks.Still, I'm giving these headphones 4 stars simply because they are still solid Sony bluetooth headphones and I'm convinced they have the build quality to last for many years.

R3ORZ4EM75GKLY,B07WSKKYPR,5.0 out of 5 stars Really good for the money.,Scott,5,"Ordered these to replace some wired headphones that I was using for Zoom calls. My wife has the more expensive pair and while hers are truly nice, these are truly inexpensive. If you are on the phone all day, you may want to consider letting go of more cash for the nicer phones. However, for the calls I do, these are fantastic. My goal was to free up a USB port and start using Bluetooth. These work great. The sound quality is fantastic, they are lightweight and most of all, they are affordable. There are some negative points too. Here is my assessment.Pros: - Price, for the money, these are great little headphones. - Sound Quality, again, the sound quality is really good. - Pairing is very easy - Weight, they are very lightweight. - Microphone, it is built into the right ear pad but people say they hear me just fine, as good as my wired set I was using.Cons: - Ear pads are too small. I am a larger man and they do not surround my ears. - Cheap construction. Feels very ""Plastic-y"". I am hoping they will be durable enough for what I use them for. - Controls too close to the microphone. Now there is no need for this one. Adjusting volume during the call is done with buttons on the ear piece themselves. So everyone on the call can hear you fumbling with the volume controls. Way around that, mute to adjust volume I guess. But they could have put the mic on the other ear piece.Unknowns: - Battery Life, haven't had them that long so I am not sure on battery life.

R29WO5882Y6BJ2,B07WSKKYPR,5.0 out of 5 stars Decent budget invesment,AngDess,5,"I've owned these for a little over a month now and have gotten some time to make some deductions...Reason for purchase - my day to day headphones are AirPods, which I love. I own an Apple TV, and wanted some overhead headphones to pair for movies, especially at night, to avoid disturbing my neighbors. At first, I wanted one of the more expensive headphones (like the Beats or even higher priced Sonys) but wasn't ready to pay so much for something I'm not even using frequently.Pros -These are nice and light, with swiveling ear pieces. The battery life is great (35+ hours on one charge) - I have yet to charge them honestly! As soon as you turn it on, there's a voice indicating the battery percentage which is great. The sound quality is pretty good considering the price, though I'm sure there is better (no noise cancelling capabilities). The Bluetooth is 5.0 so the connectivity is reliable, works well in range, and more importantly helps maximize the battery life. I honestly connect it to my Apple TV and forget I'm not near the TV as I roam around my apartment. I love the simplicity of the cups design, just the logo.Cons -During ongoing phone calls, it's hard to ignore the light echo of your own voice. I can also faintly hear my footsteps while walking around my neighborhood, which could made these challenging to use in a busier setting like a city. The ear cups create a nice suction, but after a few hours, especially with my earrings, my earlobes get a little sore or just feel pressed. There are only 3 buttons on the right cup (skip - power/play - rewind); for some reason (might just be me), since I have it paired to more than one device (in my case my phone and my apple tv), I can't quite figure out how to make it ""discoverable"" without disabling my Bluetooth on the previously connected device.In spite of the cons, for the price, I am satisfied with this purchase. I probably would use these to travel via plane BUT with no headphone jack, (depending on the airline company) I'd be limited to wireless on my personal devices.

Good price, but lacking (and inaccurate Amazon description)",Somebody,3,"The first thing I noticed unboxing these as that they feel cheap, because they are. The plastic they're made of is light and almost seems brittle. The ear pads aren't terribly soft like some other brands. There is no padding on the top, and since I shave my head, that's really annoying having the bare plastic scrape against my scalp. I really wish they would have spend an extra $1.15 and put padding up there. The noise cancellation isn't even noticeable compared to other brands I own. If I sit next to a fan (which should be easily canceled out), I honestly can't hear a difference between the headphones being on and the headphones being off. Compare that to another brand and the sound of the fan is completely canceled. While the description on Amazon claims ""smart noise cancellation"" those words appear nowhere on the box and I can't find any reference to noise cancellation in the (very tiny) instructions. Nor could I find that on Sony's web site description about these headphones. I'd have to say the Amazon description for them is wrong.On the plus side, the sound is decent. It's not as great as my Bose, but then again these headphones cost a fraction of the price, so I'd say the sound they provide is a good deal. The bluetooth paired quickly and easily with my Android phone, and a double tap of the power button brought up the Google Assistant. I could pair the headphones with multiple devices, however in order to switch between them, I would have to turn the active device's bluetooth off, then move to the other device and force it to connect. Again, my Bose headphones allow me to flip between multiple devices with a button (although, again, the Bose are fare more expensive). I also paired them with my Windows laptop, but had issues with Zoom. The microphone appeared to work and others could hear me, but I couldn't get the headphones to work, despite playing with the settings.Sony has an app for headphones in the Google Play store, however these headphones don't appear to work with it, which was disappointing. I was hoping to find additional settings in there and thinking maybe that it leveraged the app and the phones microphone to accomplish ANC through software, but that doesn't appear to be the case.All in all these headphones are just OK. I'd give them a solid ""C"". You can't beat the price, however I think this is definitely a case where you get what you pay for. I think I'm going to return these and spend $30 more and get something better, especially since I can't get them to work with Zoom, which is a show-stopper for me.","Reviewed in the United States September 2, 2022",AG3P3V6HGGDSHDWCQFWPCGKUCKZQ,True,24,Color: Black

What these headphones lack in sound quality (they are good but not great) is more than made up for by the excellent design, material quality, and build quality. Simply put, these headphones don't fall apart after a few months. We own two pairs, this model and it's predecessor that is still going strong after five years. In the long run they're a bargain, unlike J Labs and other no name products that look similar but fall apart within months.","Reviewed in the United States June 28, 2024",AFR3LUGAP3XIRRDS7QZTDUEDDGNA,True,0,Color: Black
R1OEL92ZZ05B0O,B07WSKKYPR,4.0 out of 5 stars Randomly disconnects when calling on discord.,lol,4,"I'm a first time headphone user and this is my first headphone. Overall, it's pretty great with a few minor problems.Reviews said the on-ear headphones later gets a little uncomfortable and your ears hurt a bit. That's definitely true, but I do minor adjustments or take off the headphones to relieve it and put it back on. Honestly for me it's not troublesome anyways, sometimes I just keep it on even if it does feel uncomfortable.I'd say the problem for me is the connection when it comes to calling. It takes a good minute or so to ACTUALLY connect even when it says ""blue-tooth connected"". The other day it randomly disconnected when I was in a discord call; I was just playing games with my friends until suddenly I don't hear them and soon the sound is coming from my laptop instead of my headphones. I had to manually reconnect the headphones again. This problem occurred one time though because I don't often call with headphones, but if it happens again I'll probably update this review. This problem doesn't occur when I'm listening to music for hours on end.(IDK if this is relevant, but I wore these headphones over my beanie hat btw, and the music quality is still great.)Also to add the call quality; you can hear your own background noises enhanced, I hear my papers crinkling and my stuff shuffling around when I'm in call with others; when you're in call you're music gets a bit drowned out to have a lowered volume. These aren't big issues though. I was also worried about sounding like I'm underwater but my friends told me I sound clear enough and it's normal if I sound a bit underwater anyways (whatever, as long as they hear me!).BTW I haven't used these headphones to call over the phone, just on my laptop on discord. So I can't say for sure how these headphones are, but when I do use them to call over the phone I'll update the review.Last one is a minor problem and it's the button functions; when I want to go back to the last song, it instead replays the song I'm currently listening. It takes a few attempts for the headphones to actually go back to the last song. Not a huge problem because I only use the button function when I'm too lazy to use my phone.But yeah, overall I like these headphones as my first one. I thought I'd regret it because of the uncomfortable ear part, but I like using these headphones when I want to draw and listen to music. Playing horror games with friends is also a blast!","Reviewed in the United States December 29, 2022",AFN6L5RXW2CFEQSLODUDTJEGOJMA,True,8,

RG803AIQO9ZCV,B07WSKKYPR,4.0 out of 5 stars Good for the price 😃,Saf,4,"This is my second time buying these headphones, they are a pretty well-rounded affordable pair I would recommend to anyone who wants decent headphones on a budget. They are not noise cancelling however if you turn them up loud enough you won't really be able to hear that much of what's going on around you. The only problem I would say is if you connect to both the audio and microphone for phone calls, unlike just audio for listening they tend to pick up every little sound in the background which can be a bit annoying if you are using them with the mic/for calls, but other than that, I have no other complaints. But what I will say is, I wish they could bend smaller so that they would be easier to fit in some bags and places. The only reason my last ones broke was because I slept with them on and took them off, then rolled over and broke them, but they lasted for a while and never failed me💀. ALSO these things take fast to charge, only about 90 minutes then boom, they last for 12-48hrs depending on how much you use them, how high your volume is, and whether or not your using the mic. The buttons are pretty self explanatory but if you are confused they come with a little manual and the cushions are pretty soft as well. Long story short, if you are on a budget get them then save up for a better pair later on....","Reviewed in the United States August 31, 2023",AGIN3I4NXV7UEZMD6D6Z3H7AJMPQ,True,2,Color: Black

Not bad, but somewhat muffled. I'm not an audio pro, but I'd say it'sREALLY trying to force out the Bass and ends up drowning everything out. However, if you're getting them for music and happen to have an app that allows you to tune your audio, you can get this sounding WAY better than it does out of the box. I personally use 'MP3 Player' by accountlab on the Android Play Store(Been using it for years, great app). Messing with the Bass and all the other settings got me to a very nice place with the Audio.The Build quality is a bit.. questionable.. I feel like it'll break very easily, it feels that flimsy. However, that also means it's light as heck.35 Hours of potential use is VERY nice too.TLDR;Pros :-Weight-Wireless-35 Hour Battery-Buttons and their positionsNeutral :-Audio (Can Potentially be better)-Comfort-Build Material-Passthrough Sound (Echo)Cons :-Very Light Bass-Absolutely no Noise CancelingIf I have an unexpectedly bad time with this, I'll definitely be changing my review but these are definitely good headphones that I'd recommend, especially if they go on discount, for now. Sony Rarely Disappoints.....just wish the black ones were in stock when I bought these.....EDIT : After having some time with the 'echo' thing from other reviews, I realize that it's supposed to be a sound passthrough feature. It would theoretically let you hear your surroundings even with the headphones on and it technically does do that. The issue is that it usually has a major delay and that's what makes it sound like an echo. If it were synced properly, it'd be a pretty nice feature... but yeh...","Reviewed in the United States June 26, 2021",AFCRESMQAZ5KNQ6SKJ6DBPXKOSGA,True,0,

In addition to what I said below, the amount of pressure on the side of my head is oppressive. If you are a smaller person and don't have pumpkin head like me you will probably not have as big a problem.. I think this one is going to be given to my son. He got his head from his mother. I understand she wants it back. (lame humor alert)Original Review:Paired well with my PC.. great for Zoom meetings. Sound quality is acceptable.. The ear pads are a little uncomfortable. This why I did not give four stars. It is ok for a 1 hour meeting but might get a little annoying over time. The fake leather does not breath and increases surface pressure where a foam pad might not be as uncomfortable. If I could remove it to expose the foam underneath I would. Seems like this would damage the foam. Note to Sony. Swap the fake leather for for some cloth fabric.So overall a decent buy... If you want something you can wear for hours this may not be for you.One note on pairing. I had to unpair my PC to pair with my iPhone... Seems it can pair with one device at a time.

RD9S2MB2A4W94,B07WSKKYPR,"3.0 out of 5 stars Not that loud, but have a great battery life.",Josh Dawson,3,"Upsides:They charge pretty fast considering the battery life. They last most of the day at full volume listening for around 10hrs. Have volume muttons, so if you know what your doing you and separate device volume and headphone volume to make them a bit louder. The play pause button has a secondary funtion that can be set on some devices and used to do stuff like open a certain app, hang up a call, or activate Google assistant.They don't have much battery. The earpads do a good job a at blocking sound out and keeping others from hearing what you're listening to.Downsides:Shollow depth range, high and low tones can only go so high or so low and make it sound kind of waters down when compared to other headphones. They don't have much bass or get berry loud. Because of those two facts it also makes them so an euilizer dosen't really do much to make the sound better, e.g. can't bush bass or high tones limits because they're physically not capable of it. The bass is pretty much nonexistent, the bass really isn't bass when it gets, or should I say is suppose to get louder, it just makes things sound more muffled so it seems a little like bass, but it isn't, making anything like, rap, edm, dubstep, ect. loose it's sound quality the more you turn it up. There is also an echoing type sound when using the mic, I thaught there was somthing wrong with them but turns out it's a ""feature"" built into the headphones that can't be disabled called ""voice sideton"". They say it's there so that when you use your mic you can pay closer attention to your own voice volume so you don't talk too loud. But to me it's just destructing and sounds weird. So any time you youse the mic you'll hear your own voice echoing in the headphones no matter what.","Reviewed in the United States January 30, 2022",AEHL2M7C7E3JN6HFFN5LDBTVZURQ,True,0,

They paired easily with an old Samsung TV. Simple to set up. The only thing I would hold against them is that if you have a small to average sized head, then they should fit just fine, but if you have a larger than average head, these might be a little tight. I don't use the noise cancellation feature as it messes up the sound on all headphones. I would definitely recommend these if you want exercise headphones that stay on, or like me you can't find earbuds that stay in your ears, then these sonys are great.

Not only does the plastic head band feels so cheap (it feels like those free headphones that they provide you on an airplane lol), but it also feels like it can break at the slightest touch. I wouldn’t say it’s a good “budget” pair of headphones because it’s $60, but it’s something.And another IMPORTANT thing to note: if you dislike hearing yourself/the environment while on a call, this (and I believe all pairs of Sony headphones) has a feature called SIDETONE and is incredibly annoying. It’s basically an echo where you can hear yourself and your surroundings when on any type of call i.e. FaceTime, Discord, etc. You can look this up for more info.Overall, I wouldn’t recommend anyone to get this unless you like the SIDETONE feature or if you have $60 to spare on less-than-average wireless headphones. I wanted to like these because it’s cute and the sound quality is there, but I really do recommend staying away from these headphones.","Reviewed in the United States August 8, 2022",AFZN5VYSZPFEQ6VA24JY5CLMVEDA,True,6,Color: Black
R3TVW1EYMLZQVD,B07WSKKYPR,4.0 out of 5 stars I paid $40 and I got a good pair for $40.,Joshua Gentile,4,"First of all, I just want to note I paid $40 for these. I do not like earbuds at all so I needed a pair of on ear headphones for listening to audiobooks at night and talking on the phone at night because I have hearing issues and speaker doesn't cut it when I want to talk and game.Sound quality is ok. It's not particularly great but for voice it's fine. Music is ok but generally lacking bass, but I paid $40. The only time I will be listening to music on these are for yard work where I'm I'm fine with low quality. I have a $130 Audio Technica pair for really listening to music. The mic is fine for calling.The build quality on these are not for people who bang up their stuff. It's plastic and not a super strong one either. If you take care of it, you won't have issues though.Battery life however is excellent. I couldn't be happier in that regard.Overall giving these 4 stars. Are these worth $60, no. However for $40 I think these are probably some of the best bang for the buck you will find.

R1Y4DLKBZKGH94,B07WSKKYPR,5.0 out of 5 stars Fantastic headphones!,Anna Lee Leuterio,5,"The CH510s are fantastic headphones. Here are a few pros:- Extremely low-profile and lightweight. It doesn't look like military-grade earmuffs!- Audio quality is fantastic for the price. Not as good as some of the other earphones out there (like the XM4s), however the audio is crisp and you can hear clearly.- The ear cups are adjustable, which makes it easier to store in a case or otherwise have it take up less space.- No leakage at all. Even from ~2/3ft away, no one was able to hear my music playing.There were two things that really bothering me. First off, I'm used to headphones with aptX (thus, low latency), and the CH510s are quite a departure from that. I've noticed quite a bit of latency whilst using them, although it doesn't bother me too much. Another thing that bothered me was the ear cups. After about two or three hours of use, it can start to make your earlobes uncomfortable. Don't keep it on your ears for too long without a break.All in all, this product is fantastic.","Reviewed in the United States October 24, 2021",AG7OYJ6HNH4LCAC3MHT4NFONHA2A,True,0,Color: Black

R2V6RACEBD3XET,B07WSKKYPR,5.0 out of 5 stars Very impressed by these,Jen,5,"I bought these for my 10 year old son for Christmas to replace a different pair of wired Sony headphones that he had. He loved his old pair, but the wire was getting obnoxious for him these past two years so we decided it was time to look at wireless options. He was so used to his other set, that I wanted something very similar but I also didn’t want to spend more than $40. He’s also very petite for his age (he fits a size 8 clothing) so finding something for him that’s comfortable is a challenge but I also didn’t want to pick out something babyish. I saw these for $34 and decided to take a chance and I’m extremely glad I did. I’m very impressed by these for a number of reasons. First- it’s wireless so that’s a huge upgrade for him. Second- it fits him very well but it also fits me, too. It’s comfortable. It’s almost noise canceling- you can still hear stuff but it sounds muffled. And the charge is amazing. He hasn’t charged it in the past 3 days and it’s still going strong. It was easy to connect to his iPhone. It feels more durable than a lot of the headphones out there. I feel like, if you’re on a budget or just not wanting to spend hundreds on a pair of headphones- if you’re a child, teen or adult- these work really well. I’m so glad we found these. I’m extremely happy. And our picky son is happy, too.","Reviewed in the United States December 29, 2019",AHAH4SKDX5HQD6NAZ4UIWV5BN7NA,True,10,Color: Black
R3S714PH6OACRO,B07WSKKYPR,"3.0 out of 5 stars As pure headphones, great! As a headset, hot trash.",Alexander Bates,3,"I purchased these in summer of 2020, and they held up nicely until one the sound started to give out on the left side -- probably due to me throwing it straight in my backpack on trips without any case.As some other users have mentioned, the sound is INCREDIBLE for the price, but see my caveat below. The battery life was the most impressive feature. I could go for hours and hours before even getting down to 70% battery.A huge con was the echo feature when on calls or using the microphone -- what I mean is that you can hear yourself talking and any ambient noise around you being repeated through the speakers, with seemingly no way to turn it off. (In other words, you're hearing what's coming through the microphone, mixed in with any other audio.) Additionally, in this mode, the audio quality on a call from the other end takes a serious hit. (Full disclosure: I do still use the headphones for discord calls or when streaming, but I've just gotten used to the echo/talkback. This is exclusively because I'm too cheap to buy a new pair yet.)I would say these headphones are perfect for someone who just wants to listen to music or podcasts, but they are hot trash whenever used on a call. I'd also recommend getting a case or keeping them in a safe place when not in use, as they are kind of fragile. For pure headphones purposes, they're a great price. But as a headset, you could do way better.","Reviewed in the United States June 12, 2021",AFQ3RL6T4YNYECT3BLQJKMVELVVA,True,1,Color: Black
R3PXVC1KLEYV16,B07WSKKYPR,"2.0 out of 5 stars Great for listening to music, not so great for calls, and they may hurt your ears.",AnnMarie,2,"So I got these headphones a couple months ago. I’ve used them a handful of times, and I can’t quite put my finger on whether I love them or hate them. I guess I hate them? Regardless, I’m disappointed.If you’re looking for decent sound quality and a long lasting battery, great. They work well. But there’s just a couple of large problems.The headphones are super snug, and if you’ve got a normal to large sized head, they will hurt your ears guaranteed. And they’ll hurt within a few minutes. Maybe you’ll be able to power through that. But if not, don’t get these. You’ll take them off and feel like your ears did the Kylie Lip Challenge.Secondly, taking calls with these is a nightmare. Sony uses something called Sidetone on these headphones and a few other models. This means that if you’re taking calls, you’re going to hear yourself speaking through the headphones. And if there’s any bit of delay, you get terrible feedback that’s distracting and completely masks what the other person is saying during the call. What’s worse, this is a function that can’t be turned off or turned down. It just is what it is. Sorry.If you have a small head and all you plan on doing is listening to music, then these would be perfect for you. But if you have a normal to large sized head, plan on having productive conversations, and want to listen to music for a couple of hours, you’re going to suffer.I want to love these because I got them on recommendation from a friend, but I can’t. I think I’ve only used them 3 times since I got them, and I’ve tried to take 2 calls, and it did not go well because I kept hearing myself and not what the other person was saying. And after listening to music for a while, it felt like my ears were going to fall off. I’ll have to look into another pair of headphones since it’s a little too late to get a refund.","Reviewed in the United States December 24, 2021",AGKFSXGRKTRRZYCVI3FP3J4IHFRA,True,1,

And when on sale for $38, it’s a steal. All plastic, headpiece is hard, fit is decent. I mostly use these for walking. It’s much safer because there is no noise reduction. No one in real life has absolutely zero noise in the background. There is almost always something. So, if you hear something, like a bunch of bicyclists coming behind you, you can be cautious. If it were unnaturally silent, you could be oblivious and get hit, or worse! Bluetooth pairs very easily. Clunky buttons but really, you don’t need to use them very often.

Most times it is managable and easy to ignore, but when I talk with my grandma with hearing loss it makes conversing a lot harder. Due to the headphones being a smaller size, the microphone sometimes picks up the sound that is coming out of the headphones and people you are talking to can hear themselves echo.","Reviewed in the United States December 10, 2022",AEHGJIN6SN7BSDPZXV662STBZ4HQ,True,10,Color: White

The Sony wireless headphones offer comfortable cushioning around the ear and clear sound. As someone who owns both Beats and AirPods, I think these headphones hold their own. They easily pair with both my iPhone and TV for my workouts, and that is a huge plus considering they stay put during the most intense workouts I've done. They hold an excellent charge for extended periods. The only thing I wish it had was a case or bag to carry it in.

Finally broke the plastic band due to rough travel packing. Anyhow, these were name-brand (Sony), priced well, and got good reviews.The best thing about these is the battery life. I use them on 6-mile runs three times per week, and after two weeks (3-4 hours of use), the battery level still says ""fully charged."" Not sure if that's true or not, but they have never run out of power.The sound quality is o.k. Does the job, but no better than my old cheapie Chinese ones that broke. Sound cancelling is not really a thing with these; yes, it covers your ears, but that is as far as the ""noise cancelling"" goes. A pair of ear muffs would do the same job.","Reviewed in the United States December 30, 2021",AESSPM6LAKPLQDALCH3IDEUCUZ6Q,True,0,Color: Black

It certainly isn't going to be able to compete with the high dollar wireless headphones but for this price, it's worth it. Quality of sound is good. Sound canceling is alright. Like, it muffles the sound around you enough where you can just turn up the volume and it will drown it out. Construction quality is not too bad. It can handle being dropped or sat on and won't break. It charges via USB type C so that makes it easier to charge. Don't need a different charger than the one for your phone. Battery life is pretty good. It will last about 12 to 14 hours at continuous use at half volume. Not ideal for working out as it does not hold onto you very well without being uncomfortable. However, it's perfect for lounging or going for a jog around the neighborhood. I would recommend this product.

I use them mostly while working: listening to music and taking calls.They have a very balanced, neutral tone, so you can hear everything without the bottom or top end dominating. They still have plenty of bass so that I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything. If you're a, what the kids call, basshead, though, you will likely be disappointed.The best part about them is that they disappear on my head. They're super light and fit my gigantic head very easily. A lot of folks are concerned with how flimsy they feel, but I've got another set of wired Sony headphones with the same apparent build quality that have lasted me years.Battery life is as advertised, also. They last easily through a work week without charging.The microphone does a good job in my quiet home office, but I don't think it would fare well in a busier environment like a coffee shop or airport.

RB5K6SJMSES5Y,B09JB7PK6W,"5.0 out of 5 stars Give a little ""break-in"" time; NC with Smart Ambient; ""Audiophile"" Sound Quality; Not great fitment",Pumpkin,5,"Update 5 (4/13/2024) I have now went through 3 sets of these and I have the same quality issues. Either sound plays louder in the left ear, phase seems out of phase, or the bass drivers stop working - the last time for 2 days only to play for a few hours and go out again.I have a lot of JBL gear and I thoroughly love the brand. Sadly, this item, in particular, has been problematic. JBL return process has been amazing. They are taking back a set I've had for a year but this is 3 sets in one year that's not worked properly and it is super frustrating. So no hard feelings to the company. I love JBL, I am a huge fan of their stuff but these I can no longer recommend ONLY because the build quality is not made to last and work properly and the fit is temperamental in my ears. I have a set of AKG that fit much better and are more comfortable. I prefer the sound of the JBL but having to send them back for the 3rd time I am asking them to just give me a JBL credit.I am sorry to anyone who bought these based on my recommendation and had issues that I have.Update 4 (10/6/2023) I am loving these. In ways I like them better than my all-time faves the Sennheiser HD600 open back headphones. Totally different though: these are musical with rock and pop that I listen to, the HD600 are analytical and detailed. But I love these buds! Bass is really strong but not obnoxious. I hope they don't phase these out. At $50, they were a great deal. Almost wanted to buy the blue when it was available for $50 but I got 2 pair of the black. Great buds! JBL rocks! And I am an audiophile.Update 3: Received a replacement from JBL within 7 days of shipping my broken pair back after going through a chat now and explaining the problem on the JBL website. Not much grief given, honestly, took about 15 minutes. JBL charged me nothing and made the return fairly simple. I had to deliver them to the UPS store which stunk. I was sent a code to my phone for the UPS personnel to scan since I had no printer. UPS taped up the box.Update 2: On day 16, the Left earbud stopped playing as loud as the right. The left is playing too low. Now, I am having to deal with JBL to return them.Update: I lost a medium eartip. I contacted JBL and they sent me replacements within 3 days at no charge. Good customer service!The medium tips are now working well and I get seals much easier now.I notice some bass noise coming in with heavy burst of wind - denoting the authenticity RTINGS mentions - that there is low end the buds can't hide - particularly heavy wind in the mics.Loving the sound. I did buy another set! Love these buds.Also, there is a find-my-buds feature on the app that will have the buds emit a loud pitch in case you misplace or drop the bud.Ladies and Gentlemen, these buds are a TKO for $50. JBL always with the impressive prices for the quality you get IMO!When I search for audio products my search is sound-focused and dutiful (to do what I need them for). I use earbuds while I work. I am sad that I am having to replace a set of Samsung Galaxy Pro buds that lasted me over 2 years and were still going strong until I washed and dried them. Now, I am having to replace (the buds survived but the case did not). Those Samsung NGL were great buds and the JBL is going to have trouble impressing me. I was going to get the Samsung GB 2 Pro but the price and considering I lose and/or break earbuds or the earbuds fail-to-work fairly regularly, I'm not spending $200 on earbuds. I honestly don't understand why earbuds are still so high? Must be a fixed market? I wasn't impressed at first with the JBL 130. I was missing my Samsung, considerably, and feeling more sick for having wasted them. I thought the JBL were ok but were going to get annoying, probably soon, but I tried to be patient and allow some adjusting playthrough time. I voiced to my friend about the ""JBL sound"" - I thought the bass was too boosted and the treble sounded spiked / tingy in a certain frequency and lacking the top-end highs, like there was roll-off. I felt, also, that the mid-range was recessed. It's been three days and now I am jamming! I'm literally shocked: I don't know if my ears changed or the buds broke-in or if it just took some getting used to but I honestly think the sound has morphed. At first, everything had that annoying bass bleed that drives me crazy! I cannot tolerate hummy bass, or standing bass waves. Today, I noticed the bass seems like a low atmospheric concert sound and is tight and there is very little bass bleed that I am noticing - it is very tolerable, if not almost perfect! We got some very strong bass, but guess what, everything else is keeping up now! The highs now seem more mellowed in the tingy range and extending higher. I am noticing the different types of high hats. The mid-range has a good strong attack and clean - the tonal balance feels slightly warm but well detailed - like a concert. They aren't critical listening and as detailed as my Sennheiser HD600 but all of the details were there. These make rock music feel more alive, punchy and blazing guitars and lifelike vocals. RTINGS did a good job of rating these buds and leading me to them. JBL makes more concert speakers than any brand in the world and these feel like JBL did this set of earbuds right!Pros:Sound Quality - it maybe a ""fun"" sound but it is definitely enjoyable and pleasing this picky listener with everything I have thrown at it. Probably not the most delicate but great for my heavier rock stuff. Rap, pop and Christian music had enjoyable balance, too.Charging - lasts for days! I was charging my Samsung Galaxy Buds everyday. If your battery life on your earbuds is crap, these here are excellent!Noise Cancelling - I think the NC in these buds are stellar but confused me at first. I was reading they have NC with Smart Ambient which basically means they let through some higher frequencies. It was off-putting at first but this still lets me hear enough to be ""safe"" but blocks enough noise that you can wear these while driving or taking a shower and it drowns out the noise. I was amazed at how well JBL designed the NC to simultaneously make a good NC system and allowing in sounds that help me hear shoppers, voices, or other higher frequency accidents. It's like voodoo to me but I've never used anything NC before to compare it other than my Walker Razers (gun shooting / mowing headphones). I think the NC of the 130 is underrated because it is a hybrid form of Noise Cancelling. But if you want to drown out all higher frequencies these might disappoint.Connectivity - so far these things connect effortlessly and quickly.Voice Calls - has worked great so far!JBL app - worked just fine but I don't need it.Price - at $50, relative to other buds with similar sound quality, these are probably the best deal there is.Shipping - Amazon delivered on their promise to get these here in 1-day. Worth mentioning.ConsFit - I have a hard time getting these pointed in my earholes correctly and to get them to seal. They feel loose no matter which tip I use unless I do get a really good seal, and that seal can sometimes come undone. It seems to me like the earbuds themselves do not touch the lobe in any way, which forces the entire seal on the eartips, which doesn't seem like a great design to me. Further I did have some issues.Eartips - The smalls were so small they won't stay in. The mediums don't hurt my ears but a little smaller than I wish they were but they work ok. The large hurt my ears some after a few hours and they made the buds stick out from my ears even more. They stick out pretty drastically I feel like but not as silly looking as stick models.They Stick Out - this doesn't bother me much. I got the black and think they look cool in my ears but some people will probably only want buds that hide better. With the large tips they stick out past my ear lobe, but with medium they don't go past my entire outer ear but they are still out there a lot further than my old Samsung.I am strongly considering buying another pair while they are $50. I feel like this is a sweet price for buds of this caliber.","Reviewed in the United States April 12, 2023",AEIYWQILFQWQ5FGHLGBFJTZPKOJQ,True,93,Color: Black
R27YC0PA5WJWP9,B09JB7PK6W,5.0 out of 5 stars Great Sounding Buds at a Great Price,SFNY,5,"These are possibly the best ear buds you can buy for your money. First, download the JBL Headphone app. From there pairing is effortless. Please note: you can not operate these buds without app.Once you are in the app and pair, there are customizable equalizers for your listening preference. You can also make your own, which is what I did.I noticed some comments about the lack of bass, so I wanted to address this for you. There are 4 sizes of comfortable rubber ear buds. For maximum sound quality with any ear bud, you do not use the size that fits perfectly in your ear. If you do, this is where sound degradation occurs. You must use the pair (generally the largest) so it creates a seal or suction within your ear once pushed in. Notice the rubber ear bud retracts if you were to push down on it. This is what prevents sound leakage once you place into your ear.You won't be disappointed if you follow these simple steps. All the best!!","Reviewed in the United States November 14, 2023",AEJ7HSULCNIWEMDBQB2MJPKSL5AQ,True,22,Color: Black
R2LPFDTYS8FWYG,B09JB7PK6W,"4.0 out of 5 stars Feature Rich for the Price, Acceptable Performance",A. Voris,4,"I bought these to help filter out noise at the office generally for music listening. I will split the review into three section: Noise Cancelling, Sound Quality, and Other.Noise Cancelling:They will work for some people but not all. At the home office they work great, they filter out the frequency of noise produced by computer fans. However, I don't believe the noise cancelling is all that adaptive, rather it is just filtering a fixed number of frequencies. For example, the higher frequency noise from my air purifier is still noticeable, but dampened. This seems to be the case with all noise. I would expect their algorithm is doing something like filtering out the average frequencies in the average environment so overall you do indeed get a quieter listening experience. ̶I̶ ̶f̶i̶n̶d̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶""̶A̶m̶b̶i̶e̶n̶t̶ ̶A̶w̶a̶r̶e̶""̶ ̶s̶e̶t̶t̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶b̶e̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶q̶u̶i̶e̶t̶e̶s̶t̶.̶ (UPDATE: Meant to say ANC (duh) slightly confusing what mode I was in based off of the quick start manual. Ambient would be if you wanted to hear more than if the ANC was just off.) For the price this is very acceptable. The more adaptable, on the fly noise cancelling algorithms are extremely difficult to implement, and hence you pay a premium for them. Overall, I would compare these to a really good pair of foam tip IEMs in terms of noise cancellation. These will definitely not provide any hearing protection for things like shooting, loud shop work, etc... so keep that in mind and use your head.Sound Quality:These are definitely a ""consumer grade"" listening experience, which for most people won't be a bad thing. For the price I am indifferent. I would say the bass is higher than normal with more muted/muddy treble. This isn't necessarily a bad thing and I would say most people would find them ""good"". For what they cost, the sound exactly like what I would expect, better than a 20 dollar pair of headphones and not as good as a $150 dollar pair of IEMs, but your mileage may vary. For comparison with a competitor, I have some Sony wf-c500 wireless earbuds (no ANC) and these sound roughly the same, maybe slightly less clear treble and bass. I would still pick these over the Sony's because these have more features for the price and for other reasons I will list below.Other:Battery -- I think the battery life specs are roughly accurate, I get a full day on them, but haven't really pushed them to the 40 hours though. Battery life seems great, the case seems to get you maybe 2 charges. The case is nothing special, I wish the hinge had more tension in it like the Sony's so it felt more premium, I can kind of wiggle it a little bit but definitely not a deal breaker. I have yet to run them to the point where they alert you if they are low just once or they keep doing it. If they keep doing it I will update and remove a star because I don't quite understand why you would annoy the user with a message consistently for the last X% of battery (original rating is 4 stars).Size and Eartips -- these are rather large, but acceptable given the price and feature set. They don't fit in the ear as well as the Sony ones do but they don't seem to fall out either. The Sony design fits into the ear better and ""hugs"" it so to speak, they seal better as well. I do really wish these came with a set of foam tips, they would actually compete in a different price bracket for that much, mainly because of the noise reduction. They would also help the fit. The included silicon ear tips are like the cheapest on the market, not as supple as more premium earbuds. There's nothing inherently wrong with them but they may rip after a while. I think if JBL addressed the fit (decrease the depth of the ""body"" in the ear so they seal better since there would be less weight pulling down on the eartip) and eartips they'd have an extremely solid 50 dollar pair of earbuds.Controls - ̶U̶n̶l̶e̶s̶s̶ ̶I̶'̶m̶ ̶m̶i̶s̶s̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶i̶t̶,̶ ̶I̶ ̶d̶i̶s̶l̶i̶k̶e̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶c̶o̶n̶t̶r̶o̶l̶s̶ ̶d̶o̶ ̶n̶o̶t̶ ̶h̶a̶v̶e̶ ̶v̶o̶l̶u̶m̶e̶ ̶a̶d̶j̶u̶s̶t̶m̶e̶n̶t̶,̶ ̶m̶a̶s̶s̶i̶v̶e̶ ̶m̶i̶s̶p̶l̶a̶y̶ ̶f̶r̶o̶m̶ ̶J̶B̶L̶,̶ ̶l̶o̶o̶s̶e̶ ̶a̶ ̶s̶t̶a̶r̶ ̶f̶o̶r̶ ̶t̶h̶i̶s̶.̶ ̶I̶ ̶d̶o̶ ̶n̶o̶t̶ ̶w̶a̶n̶t̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶h̶a̶v̶e̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶i̶n̶v̶o̶k̶e̶ ̶a̶n̶ ̶a̶s̶s̶i̶s̶t̶a̶n̶t̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶r̶a̶i̶s̶e̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶v̶o̶l̶u̶m̶e̶.̶ ̶T̶h̶e̶ ̶S̶o̶n̶y̶ ̶e̶a̶r̶b̶u̶d̶s̶ ̶d̶o̶ ̶h̶a̶v̶e̶ ̶v̶o̶l̶u̶m̶e̶;̶ ̶h̶o̶w̶e̶v̶e̶r̶,̶ ̶ (UPDATE: Volume controls can be added through the app as a functionality; however, you loose the ability to change noise modes. I'm still rating 4 stars because I want both, would put 4.5 but can't. I don't see why both sides need a long press for google assistant or siri, one of these long presses could change the noise mode.) I would still pick the JBL buds because the volume steps are more gradual. I can get these to a comfortable level where with the Sony ones it always either a little too loud or a little too quiet. Other than volume I love that the controls are capacitive. Sony opted for actual push buttons in theirs which makes them unusable when laying on your side or for example working on your car, as you constantly bumping/pushing the buttons inadvertently in both cases -- so big win for the JBLs.Overall, a quality earbud for the price but improvements could be made, not sure you can find a more feature rich earbud for this price.","Reviewed in the United States February 25, 2023",AEQIHIUCW2JFJZ43VNHDDSHISNYQ,True,155,Color: Black
R38SQ852C4X2MF,B09JB7PK6W,5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing sound!,Diego Garcia,5,"⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐I am blown away by the incredible sound quality of these JBL earbuds! As an avid music lover, I've tried my fair share of earbuds, but none have come close to the rich bass and clarity these deliver. The difference from off-brand earbuds is like night and day.One of the things that immediately impressed me is the perfect fit of the gummies. They sit snugly in my ears without ever feeling uncomfortable, and their thoughtful design ensures they stay in place even during rigorous activities.The touch controls are a game-changer. With just a light tap, I can effortlessly control my music and calls without having to press hard or fumble with buttons. Plus, they're so intuitive that I never forget how to use them.While the noise cancellation might not rival that of top-tier brands like Apple's 2nd Gen AirPods Pro, it's still impressive, especially considering the price difference. The talk-through feature is incredibly handy for staying aware of my surroundings while walking in public, and the mic quality during phone calls is superb. It effectively blocks out background noise, ensuring crystal-clear conversations for both parties.Overall, these JBL earbuds have exceeded my expectations in every way possible. From their impeccable sound to their comfortable fit and convenient features, they're a must-have for anyone looking to upgrade their audio experience without breaking the bank.","Reviewed in the United States April 27, 2024",AGNLDMGAGX2T64CWSRYBFUPCK6OA,True,3,Color: Black

It depends on the environment, but sometimes the noise cancelling feature can be effective or useless. It’s a similar situation with the ambient sound option, sometimes it can be easy to hear through the earbuds other times it can be challenging. Another potential downside is that if you have to move or shake your head around often, these are not good for you as they can easily fall out if you move around too much. Regardless, I would say the sound quality is good.","Reviewed in the United States May 3, 2024",AE4GPKYPDIA75YH27KSYZ2C75FFQ,True,1,Color: Blue

Better to get these on sale than other headphones for the same price regularly. The sound is good, but I can't say much for volume because of my hearing impairment and my phone regulates the sound coming out. The fit is really weird, I suggest trying every possible position before saying ""they just fall out"". The instructions give you a few positions to try, but those didn't work for me. I finally found a position where the sound was best and they didn't fall out. However, I do put them pretty deep into my ear and it's a bit uncomfortable so I have to nudge them out just a little. I think the apple airpods are way more comfortable, and other styles like those. These headphones are packed with features like integrated Alexa and an equalizer. The headphones have an app to control all of these features. There aren't any buttons, but it senses your touches very well. Overall I am pleased with them, despite the comfort issue. My ear canals are pretty big, so if you have small ears I do not recommend these. I docked them one star due to the fitting.EDIT: So I figured out how to wear these, and they are very comfortable and they do not fall out. Basically you want to put the thicker part of the earphone pointing straight down, Still might not be good for small ears, but they work perfectly for my bigger ears. My ears are not abnormally large, but I do have larger ear cavities (again, not abnormal). I wish these were a bit louder, they suck for music as compared to my Hesh Evos. However, they are perfect for movies because I can hear the dialog very well.

They did suffer moisture damage, so no fault to the headphones for depreciating over time. I didn't have an extra $300 lying around this close to the holidays, so I figured I'd spend the $50 on these. They're honestly not as bad as I expected. They feel VERY cheap - but they aint bad. I struggled with the tips of the earbuds; they kept falling out of my ear. Finally, I switched the tips to the foam tips that came with my sonys and that helped so much! I was shocked at how much more comforatble they became and I no longer had any issues with them falling out. The noise cancelling got a bit better too. Compared to my sonys, the price can't be beat. The sonys completely blocked outside noise. Where these aren't as good - I still have to take out an earbud to talk to someone because I can't hear outside noise very well. I recommend for the price - coming from the leader of the noise cancelling pack of Sony.I only rated 4 stars because in my option, without foam tips, they're kind of trash. I have small ears and I felt like the in-ear piece didn't go in far enough to my ear canal. The moment I switched to the foam tip, they were perfect. That's how much of a difference it made, but I may have been spoiled from my sonys foam tips. If you have issues like this, try the foam tips. They're like $12 for a pack of three on here.

It was so loud we had to get outside before my ears rang off my head. My husband popped in his headphones and turned on the noise cancelling, and he said he couldn’t even hear the fire alarm system.I can hear him clearly while we are on the phone while he’s on a job site. Heavy machinery and people talking to him are cancelled out as a listener. I’m mildly deaf, so it’s hard for me to hear him anyways. JBL nailed it when it comes to clarity.He says his music bumps like you’re in the car with subs. He doesn’t have to turn on his music to such a high volume to have clarity either.There are two different modes so when people approach you, you can hear them talking and respond to them quietly, and noise cancelling. When you switch modes to hear people, it still plays the music and uses the microphone to pull the sound into the earbud like a hearing aid!Battery life is 10/10He said his battery life is always charged. He hasn’t been able to use them from alive to dead because they are always charging in the case or when you put one in and use another and switch. The battery has only been charged once since getting these a few months ago. He said he can get a total charge of 40+ hours and it’s a legit claim on the box.He said they are amazing and nothing short of that.","Reviewed in the United States December 6, 2023",AF3R37KZDCGDMOVOP52UUXTZRCMQ,True,3,Color: Black
R2YLE6449P5CYO,B09JB7PK6W,4.0 out of 5 stars Mixed Bag - Allow me to explain,C. Walbrun,4,"I bought this for rides on my bike since my other pair died after 3hours of use and I ride for a long while.Fit: This will be different for each user. They generally fit comfortably for me. On my bike they don't fall out but they are a little heavier (likely due to the battery).Battery Life: These things go on for a very long time. I get 6-7 hours with them and the case charges them fairly quickly. Generally if I'm on my bike for 7-8 hours I only need a brief 20-30 min in the case when I break for lunch to last me pretty much all day.Noise Cancelling: Pretty abysmal. They definitely do something, but it's pretty minimal. On top of that when wind blows into the mic on my bike the noise cancelling goes nuts and starts giving me weird feedback. Its best to keep it off when I'm on my bike and only on when I'm in the office.Noise Isolating: This may be subjective as well due to fit, but these let in a lot of noise while I'm riding. I hear wind a lot more than other earbuds and it's likely due to the way they are shaped. When I'm just walking around or doing housework, they are about the same as any others.Soundquality: These are ok, not the best. Bass is good, but the volume overall is lower than other earbuds. This may be an isolating issue as well.Overall experience: These are my go to earbuds due to their longetivity despite the down sides. I like them a lot for the price I paid ($65). I wouldn't pay retail for them, but recommend them at a discount.","Reviewed in the United States May 30, 2023",AFJFXL43THMCNPWWTGJW2Z3ASPLA,True,7,Color: Black

Dynamic range and volume accuracy is good. Not boom, boom, boom with ear damaging bass thump.3) Has an excellent app providing several equalizer presets. Plus you can manipulate the controls to build your own profile.4) Ability to set the actions of the buds ""switches"" when you tap them via the app.5) Noise canceling (ANS) works. You can block out the world or carry on a normal conversation with music in the background.6) The silicone in ear tips are thicker and better made than others I've had. They attached tightly to the ear bud and it doesn't seem like it will come of in your ear.7) Instruction booklet font size is readible without a magnifying glass. Usually you have to put them under bright light and use a magnifier to read them.8) Price was outstanding at 50% off. I wouldn't pay full price of around $100.00 for them. But, I wouldn't pay that much for any ear buds. I have not heard any that match my old sennheiser earphones and those would be worth it, otherwise no.Cons:1) Honestly none so far of note. Would be nice if you could extra silicone tips in a little pouch or recharging base to save them.I can't speak to play time yet but at least four hours. I've not actually used them longer than that at one sitting.Overall, highly recommend these buds.

RYM2LEY9OAB9L,B09JB7PK6W,4.0 out of 5 stars DOWNLOAD THE APP,David,4,"I actually like these headphones. The lost star is for the fact that they do not really sound that great without the jbl headphone app. Once I popped that on even just using the default eqs, 90% of my complaints evaporated.I've seen people compare these to skullcandy, I'll do the same since my last pair were skullcandy anyway.While the skullcandy delivered solid bass it did so while stomping on mids pretty badly. These do not suffer that issue. While it can be said the bass is louder on the skullcandy set. These are offering a much clearer and well rounded bass without utterly destroying the mid range, and though quiet out of the box the installation of the app brings them to the same volume the skullcandy pushed if not a little louder.Fitting them to your ear can also be a bit of trial and error. I'm actually using a different sized cup on each ear to get the best results for myself.Biggest thing is the app though, it really was a night and day difference. The default club eq seems to work for most genre's or you can of course create your own if you want to get picky.Once the fit and app are out of the way, these are not bad at all. I suppose it bears mentioning that the advertised quick charge feature actually appears to work with these. (this is something that on skullcandy's side seemed like a point blank lie)The touch sensor may be a bit on the sensitive side, but that's been true of the last 4 or so of these I've owned.This review may sound a bit critical but I'm legitimately enjoying them, largely wondering why the default profile for them sounds so bad though. The app immediately clears that up fortunately.","Reviewed in the United States March 14, 2023",AFMSREBL6VFHQ5AXCBBXUZL4HC2A,True,41,Color: Black

R3TWRHHYAV8IDN,B09JB7PK6W,4.0 out of 5 stars Pretty good customizable wireless earbuds.,Yoshi,4,"By no means am I an expert on earbuds or sound. But I'll give my input anyways. I came across these earbuds while they were 50% off. As a fan of the JBL speakers, I felt obliged to purchase and try these.The design of the earbuds are pretty stylish and look great if style is a factor for you. They are a pretty snug fit in my ears (male medium sized ears) and only really fall off after long usage due to sweat/earwax making the buds slippery. They're fine for light physical activity like walking but they will most likely slip off when doing higher intensity physical activity like running/sports. The earbuds have decent noise cancelling and also allows you to switch to ambient noise mode in which it mimics and filters outside noise through the earbuds for you to hear your surroundings.Sound wise, to be honest they were bad out of the box (in my opinion). When listening to music, the vocals and instrumentals sounded very muffled and mute even at high volume. You will need to download the JBL Headphones app to get access to the EQ as well as additional features like motion controlled shortcuts as well as an earbuds finder tool if you happen to lose a bud. With the EQ you can adjust the ""volume"" of the low, mid, and high sounds. The app comes with presets but allows you to customize your own mix. I found that increasing the slider for the mid range sounds makes the vocals and instrumentals louder/clearer and better.","Reviewed in the United States April 8, 2023",AHBUWEJXAFMQOMFH4R3H4AMFKD4Q,True,14,Color: Black

I think I’ve had these for almost a year and unfortunately they don’t hold up to use in an environment with lots of dust like a woodshop.

I'm getting a backup pair. I've flown on planes, worked on cars, driven on the highway, and have used these while power washing. In every situation, I'd rather have these in than not, wether for the impressive noise isolation or jamming out, these are a permanent, lifetime companion to me. They connect in a second or two to my 60$ Walmart phone. The case is a good shape, and I regularly get 6+ hours from just the buds. And they can go BIG on the bass. Every once in a while, one bud will get confused and think it's still in the case or out of the case, have to fiddle with it every once in a while but it's not often. The one issue I've had is it completely derping when trying to connect to my laptop. Your milage may vary, maybe my software is out of date? Dunno, just doesn't work with my Acer Nitro 5. I liked these so much, I got a pair for 2 of my close friends and they love them too. It's awesome for phone calls. Just add memory foam tips for better grip and isolation, and phone calls are excellent. They don't exactly snap in place in my ears, hence the memory foam for the extra grip from the texture. But overall, these have brought me peace and music in many, many places. I highly recommend these for people who routinely travel. Or if you're a basshead, these can shine.","Reviewed in the United States September 2, 2023",AEFXDDQA5PNGUNL6TM3FG7565BYQ,True,12,Color: Black

I was surprised at the call quality as well. They could be a bit louder but I love my music load. The only bad thing about these earbuds is that they disconnect from my phone when they’re not being used. Sometimes I put them in my shirt pocket or just leave them in my ears when I’m doing something at work, not on my phone. They just disconnect. You either have to put them back in the case or do a special tap sequence on both buds to connect them again. It’s becomes annoying after awhile. Stay connected until I put you away please.

The bass level is decent but a little muddy, the noise canceling is pretty good in my opinion.I was expecting a little better quality overall for JBL, they are not very loud and that's a shame, the app allows you to dial them in slightly bit that's it. Battery life has been great, cant conplain there, and the connectivity is good with my S21 Ultra and they are easy to use.As far as comfort, I am happy.

The earbuds have a noticeable delay in ""music"" (high fidelity) mode, and a still noticeable delay in ""video"" mode, that won't matter most of the time, but is not present in some alternative earbuds.The ANC is nowhere near perfect, but definitely cuts out low droning noises well, and brings the overall exterior volume down, even if it leaves some higher pitched noises in.The pass-through mode works pretty well, unless you're near any loud droning noises like an air-conditioning unit, in which case it boosts that noise a lot compared to other noises.Generally this is a very good product, and if you can find it on sale, I suggest purchasing it.","Reviewed in the United States July 18, 2023",AGO3V5PLVLXFFSQLQE6UREAIFQWQ,True,2,Color: Black

Not suitable for a gym where loud music is playing, but perfect for music and audiobooks at home or work.Cons: they don't stick in my ears that well, I'm an average sized male (5' 9"") and none of the rubber ear pieces worked for me. Also, this may be a matter of taste, but the controls are extremely annoying. Tapping once on the left ear bud changes the ANC setting. I found every option except the first to be unusable, it almost felt like the background noise of ANC was more noticable than the music.

R3HZ6PPJSOHXBY,B09JB7PK6W,5.0 out of 5 stars Enjoy the quiet of JBL noise cancellation,Mithrandir,5,"I bought these JBL headphones because I wanted noise cancellation without having to wear headphones. These are really earphones or ear buds, and I wasn't sure how much noise they could cancel. They cancel almost all background noise and conversation around. I can put them in and listen to an audio book in a room where other people are having lunch and talking. All that noise is gone, cancelled. The full noise cancellation setting is so good that I recommend using it only in a safe setting like sitting down in an easy chair or at a table or desk. Put on a little rainfall and go to sleep. These earphones have two other settings. One lets conversations be heard in the background, so if someone calls you, you can hear them. The third setting is no noise cancellation at all. I am totally satisfied with the noise cancellation feature of these earphones. The sound quality is among the best I have heard in earbuds. The free JBL app lets you choose the kind of equalizer settings you prefer for what you are listening to. The app is a major attraction for setting up the JBL headphones the way you want them to operate. I got exactly what I was looking for in these JBL headphones and so much more besides.

R28D8NZWTRKY1C,B09JB7PK6W,2.0 out of 5 stars Purchased this and another model— disappointing products.,Trevor,2,"I left a very similar review for another one of the JBL headphones. Unfortunately it seems that their whole product line is lacking.BLUF: Spend a couple extra bucks and get Raycon's.I was excited to try these and another model of JBL headphones out, and I got them both on a sale. I'm a fan of JBLs no-frills speakers, and I have the Boombox and one of the Charge series.Coming from Raycons, I was immediately disappointed at the sound quality and noise cancelling features. The sound quality is forgivable— it's a low to mid-range headphone that touts affordability over quality. So be it. The digital noise cancelling, however, was inferior to Raycon's basic headphone that just cancels noise with a good seal. The talk-thru feature can be useful when running with a friend, but the ambient fuzz sound that you have to put up with to use it makes it more enjoyable to just run with one bud out.Comfort is average. After long periods of use, they start to feel uncomfortable, which is to be expected from this range of headphone.The thing that makes this a two-star product for me is the charging case. From day one, the headphones would randomly come off the charger and connect to my phone with me realizing. So the battery would drain on the headphones, and then if I wanted to play something over my speaker or connect another set of Bluetooth headphones, I would have to manually switch devices in the settings.Starting from a couple months ago, the right earbud doesn't seem to sit in the case and won't charge— and therefore won't turn off. My phone is basically perpetually connected to these things now. The only thing that seems to fix that charging problem is for me to take out and reinsert the earbud multiple times to hopefully make the connection.All in all, these would be passable headphones if it weren't for the deteriorating conditions of trying to charge these things. I will not be purchasing JBL headphones again.","Reviewed in the United States December 26, 2023",AFFRD6QV336EYDBZMIFMHHFURIPQ,True,0,Color: Black

Due to this, I was finding myself constantly adjusting and putting them back in, which to me is just not worth it. I have found that if I wear a beanie, this will help them stay put.

These Fail at Random, Early, and Often",Bingo,2,"Pros:1)These provide decent quality audio (when/if they function).2)The noise cancellation is there, it kinda works, enough to be a feature anyway. NOTE: the NC is inferior to all other brands I have heard, but it does function kinda so I listed it as a pro.3) Battery life is great (Their best quality)Cons:1) The controls are not intuitive2) They are not reliable at all!!!. First the right ear started playing at an incredibly low volume so that I had to crank up audio to 11 to hear anything. They, without warning, they would suddenly work, and threaten to blow out my ear drums. This started the 3rd week I owned them. Recently, this problem randomly switched to the left ear, and the right seems to function properly3) The fit is really wierd, everyone who tries these out cant seem to get them to stay in their ears (I have had several people try)4) they fall out ALL the time5) they cut out at random6) The build quality feels very VERY low. The case is garbage, the buds feel like they are garbage, and based on performance I have received, I am vindicated in this belief.7) Their app wants permissions that are irrelevant to audio and that amount to stalker level request for info, and you can not control any functions or access the app without giving them permission to access your location, all your data (pictures and videos too), call records, etc. I can't believe they even asked for this info, but you can not even access certain functions of these garbage ear buds unless you grant them access.OVERALL: These are pure, Grade A, 100%, unadulterated Crap. The sound quality is mid level at best. To be fair, battery life is superb, but that is the only redeeming quality. These ear buds are terrible overall, obviously built to extremely low standards, and based on this experience I will NEVER buy another JBL product again after this. I have owned JBL stuff many times in the past with mixed results, but this was the nail in the coffin. The fact that these are sold anywhere but a dollar store is the true mystery. The fact that JBL put their name on this inferior Horse S*** is what makes me never want to give JBL my money again.If you buy these, expect disappointment.","Reviewed in the United States August 5, 2023",AFECBUN57B4A3TB6JVXKTE7TDVVQ,True,3,Color: White

I misplaced them for a while before realizing what a good thing I had, so tested 3 different kinds before finding them again. While the others were OK, none compared to the comfort, ease of use, or battery life to these. And now they are my absolute faves! And these have had 1-6 hours of use nearly every day over the past 2 years.PROs:SUPER comfy.Active playtime lasts for at LEAST 3 HOURS of constant use, and recharge super fast. (Have tested on numerous long road trips.) Standby battery power lasts for several days.Work GREAT in small ear canals, which is how I originally found them (thank you Amazon reviewers!) However, even though these work great for small ears ""out of the box"", I ordered smaller silicone tips to replace the smallest ones that came with the set. With that adjustment, these are perfection!Call answer/disconnect is perfect. This is also the pause/play, but functionality depends on the app.Volume controls are great - LOVE that you can feel the +/- buttons so you can do it without looking.They don't fall out easily, but they don't create that ""suction"" feeling in your ear like with other in-ear squidgy silicone buds.Sound cancellation is a little too good with both earbuds in, so I usually wear just one at a time (especially when driving! BONUS: can hear map instructions much more clearly when playing through the headphones instead of over the car stereo) with the cord draped around my neck, and the other either looped over the cord or tucked into my shirt.Can switch L/R ears without discomfort, but they do fit and feel a bit better in the ""correct"" ear.Work GREAT in small ear canals, which is how I originally found them (thank you Amazon reviews!)Sound quality is excellent for speech (yay podcasts and movies!) and really good for music.

R5A9J2QL9WQGV,B07Q8TFRM7,4.0 out of 5 stars A good pair of reasonably priced bluetooth headphones with some drawbacks.,beebo,4,"The headphones have above average sound quality with an acceptable amount of audio delay. The pairing process is painless (save for issues pairing with windows, but that's their fault, not the devices.) Keeping it paired with multiple devices and switching between them is relatively easy. However, there is a minor audible hiss in the background when no audio is playing. Oftentimes, this hiss will only last a short time before cutting to silence, however, other times it will remain indefinitely as long as there is no playing audio. That, however, is a minor complaint compared to the issue with the battery percentage notification. It is effectively useless to actually determine the level of charge. The device appears to use tiers of charge regardless of it stating a percentage. If, for example, your battery is at approximately 51%, the device will claim it is 70%. If when that charge drops below a threshold will it change. It always declares that the charge is the higher of the thresholds, meaning that if the charge is above 70% it will always say it is fully charged, and when it is below 70 but above 50, it will claim it is 70% charged. This makes accurately determining when it is fully charged impossible as the claim of ""fully charged"" only actually tells you it is above 70%.If you disregard the absolutely heinous charge level indication, the battery life is pretty great. I get a full two days of moderate on and off use before having to charge them. I can't confirm that the 15 hour claim is true due to never having used them for that long, nor counting exactly how long they get used per day comparatively, but they appear to have a very good battery life regardless.The magnets honestly may as well not be there for how weak they are. They'll stay together if you're just sitting in a chair, but as soon as you move around, they immediate separate. This isn't as much of a problem for me, due to me basically never even wearing them if I am not using them, so I never actually have the need for them to be hanging connected to eachother, but if you intend to be wearing them and not using them, you may want to get some kind of clip.The flat cables are not attached parralel to eachother, so when attached together via the (very weak) magnets, the rotate in one direction or the other making them dangle a bit off to the side. It's a meaningless gripe due to me never even using them that way (as mentioned before) however it may be a problem for you.They are very susceptible to earwax. There is a teeny tiny hole in the center that, if even slightly covered with any amount of wax, will immediately dampen the sound to imperceptible levels. It's easy to fix with a needle or even your pinky nail, but if you let that build up over time or just have waxy ears, I can see that becoming a hard issue to overcome.Other than those issues, I am still very satisfied.","Reviewed in the United States July 9, 2020",AEEJAOQQMIT5N2LHODBC7XZUP2LQ,True,9,Color: Black
R1KMQCOEVEICLN,B07Q8TFRM7,5.0 out of 5 stars Great bluetooth headphones for the price if you like the form factor and want USB-C charging,Mike,5,"These are fantastic headphones for the price (just under forty bucks for me), especially if you like the form factor and want USB-C charging. I'll start with what I didn't see yet confirmed in other reviews, these work on all USB-C chargers that I've tested them on so far. This includes several different Power Delievery (USB-C PD) chargers, laptop chargers, Nintendo Switch charger, and USB-A to C chargers. I'm sure there's some funky charger somewhere out there that won't charge this, but they seem to be pretty broadly compatible.I like the neckband style headphones for work, I can pop them in and out quickly and just let them dangle around my neck when not in use, don't need to hunt for their case like true wireless buds or risk losing them. These sit well around the neck , the cord length is pretty ideal not too long, not too short, and the battery life is fantastic, I can get multiple days of here and there use out of a single charge.The sound quality is average. I think it's good for the price point, but doesn't compete with most headphones in the $100+ category. For the price, my music sounds good, highs, mids, and lows are all reasonably balanced. There's some white noise when audio isn't playing, there's a tiny bit even when audio is playing. If most headphones sound fine to you and you're not someone who already has multiple pairs of over $100 headphones, these are going to sound great. I have too many headphones including several premium pairs of over ear cans, true-wireless, etc. and these are still my new daily drivers for a while.Eartips are comfortable, noise isolation is on par with any in-ear headphones with a decent seal. No active noise cancelling, and no smart features like pausing your muslc when you take out a headphone or resuming when you put them back in. Microphone works well, used them on some conference calls and video chats with no complaints. Pairs with two devices but not simultaneous. Can't play audio from two sources at the same time or be actively connected to two sources, but remembers two devices and swapping between them is easy.

R3442X8C4GPSLV,B07Q8TFRM7,5.0 out of 5 stars They’ll play your sweet melodies as gentle or as loud as you like.,Eduardo Gallegos,5,"They survived tug of war between my 3 year old niece who wanted to listen to music and my worried hands that didn’t want to ruin them. Excellent choice for anyone who likes great earphones without a premium price tag. I’ve used these earbuds weekly for about three months And find them supremely comfortable using the smallest earpieces. The sound is what you’d expect from Sony. They aren’t very large so don’t expect thunderous bass, but they’re large enough so they don’t slide out of your ear. Sony has included three different pairs of silicone ear pieces so you’ll find a comfortable size. An added benefit is they are water resistant. I don’t recommend you submerging them in water, but if you’re out on a run you don’t have to worry about a little rain. For such a small unit they have a pretty wide range of distance between the source and the headset. So if you ever find yourself needing to set your phone down to clean the wire isn’t long enough to get in the way, and you’ll be able to change the volume or song with a reasonable amount of distance. They also support voice controls. When in a phone call or voice control you’ll be able to hear yourself. This could either be good or bad depending on your personal taste. I’m not aware of users being able to turn this feature off. The one con I can think of is there’s been times when I’ve rested my head on the controls and the audio pauses. I believe this is a feature because as I mentioned they have quite a bit of range. Also Sony has this feature in some of the higher headsets. It’s so you can hear your surroundings. Regardless I notice the music stopping when I’m dozing off, then continue when I lift my head. Another thing I wish Sony would do is ship these units with two charging cables. The one included is short and there really isn’t a need for it to be larger in my opinion. But it is a USB C, this is my only device that uses such cable, so it would be nice to have a spare. Overall I highly recommend for anyone looking for great sound at a budget price with pretty solid construction.","Reviewed in the United States December 12, 2019",AHGROWEJKFTLFDXLME54NSHW7LBQ,True,1,Color: Black
R17MARQLUDRPRJ,B07Q8TFRM7,3.0 out of 5 stars Could use some work,Joey,3,"So I replaced a set of BeatsX because at over $100 each time they broke, i was geting annoyed. These are value priced... and you get what you pay for.Pros:- Battery life is GREAT- llike beats, you can do a quick charge for about 10 min and get a few hours- if you already have USB-C devices, it's easy to charge up for a few min- the power on/off, pairing, and battery life voice sounds they make are very helpful, i wish beats did that.- once they stop receiving sound to play, they go into a bluetooth low-power mode, that let's they stay connected, but doesn't drain battery almost at all. this makes them the longest lasting earbuds i've ever had. i listen at night to ASMR before bed, and in the morning they're still connected and i listen to music all day. Battery life is great.Cons:- Cord is very uncomfortable, it slides back and forth on your neck, and the mid-sections are thick and annoying because the buttons are very hard and rough.- the buttons are made of razer blades, i don't understand how sony can make BUTTONS be thin tiny plus and minuses and one big minus. it's impossble to tell which button your finger is on by touch, there's just nothing to feel, they are so thin and so brittle they feel like you're just running your finger over a knife, pressing them is actually HARD to do, you have to dig your finger nail into them, and they don't give much. the middle button which does EVERYTHING is hard to figure out which one it is too.- the main button is confusing. it turns it on and off, but beyond that it doesn't work consistently. Pressing it doens't PLAY or PAUSE on an iphone, pressing and holding doesn't launch sirri, tapping it once, twice or three times, does NOTHING. if you press it JUSSSSST RIGHT as in press and hold for almost a second, it'll do play or pause. to turn it on or off, you have to press it for about 3-5 seconds. to do pairing, you have to hold it for 5+ seconds.- there's no way to skip or fast forward on iOS. I've tried and nothing happens. why they couldnt do like every other set (double tap to skip, triple click to skip back) is beyond me. trying the tap tap-hold like fast forward on apple earbuds and beats and others, usually just turns these off. I don't know if this is by design or defective.- not every USB C cable fits in it's plug because the cover flap and the housing gets in the way.- you can't do multi-point connect. It SAYS it can on the box and manual, but it can't, while it's connecting to one device, anything else can't connect. If you put it in pairing again, it'll connect to the new thing and disconnect from teh last device. this doesn't make any sense since it says how to do this in the instructions, yet it doesn't work.- though they LOOK like BeatsX, they don't have a semi-rigid band on the neck, it's just loose cord, so it swings and pulls on your hair and gets uncomfortable if they fall off your shoulders.- you can't listen to one earbud by itself, the weight of the whole set pulls it out of your ear.So all in all, they are a net positive, but I wish Sony would make some premium buds in the EXACT same style, with this small of a bud design. I'd gladly pay double.Just in case you're curious if I got a bootleg counterfeit or not? I registered these with SONY, and they're legit. so maybe defective, but not fake. so that's at least good.","Reviewed in the United States May 15, 2020",AFXEXGZILUHKXKYZFACRRJBUHGKA,True,8,Color: Black
R3G1X89NSO2Q4B,B07Q8TFRM7,5.0 out of 5 stars Best headphones for the money,Daniel T.,5,"I have used these almost everyday for over a year now. This is a solid review because I put these thing through hell. They are tied in a knot around my neck every single day. I use them as ear pro (they are not rated as such however) because they seal so nicely in the ear. They charge fast and the battery seems to last forever. Even when I leave them in the cold near freezing the battery seems not to be affected terribly. These are constantly being tugged and pulled on, dropped on the ground, dropped in wet places and after a quick wipe off they are good to go. On the day I got them they accidentally fell on the ground outside the car and there was a huge rainstorm that night. I assumed they were goners but to my surprise they were perfectly fine to this day. Just remember to keep the charging cover closed. The sound is not Beats By Dre but neither is the price. I listen to a lot of blues and Amazon books and country and between them the sound is perfect. Decent bass, good highs and mids. Because the earpieces seal so well, you don’t have to crank it up all the way further saving battery life. The phone function has a crisp mic and phone calls are 1 touch answer and hang up. 5 Stars for sure from me. Hope this review helped! Remember the pics are from after a year of abuse and everything still works perfectly. I have bought these for most of my family.","Reviewed in the United States November 1, 2022",AFK7EF6UV4JGC3SGY7N52NJ4I4YQ,True,20,Color: Black
RRB2CUCF3TYBF,B07Q8TFRM7,1.0 out of 5 stars OVERALL WASTE OF MONEY! - WITH 6-WEEK AND 1-YEAR UPDATE,Giacomo Felducci,1,"I have sleeping issues, and I use Bluetooth earbuds to play soft ambient music. This has the benefit of falling asleep and then staying asleep as outside noise is filtered out.I’ve been using Beats X/Flex, but I’ve found that they’re not up to the task of this level of use so I have to replace them every year. So I started looking at different options and discovered the WIC-310’s. They were under $20 (1/3 the price of Beats Flex now) and figured I’d try them.It’s been 4 nights so far and I’m REALLY impressed. The battery life has been better than promised. Since the volume is so low, I’ve used them two nights in a row and the battery was only 50% when I woke up. That’s 14 hours of use and still had a half charge.I don’t even feel them when I sleep. The audio is really good, but I’m listening to spa/ambient music, so I haven’t played a variety of music on them. Because I play them at minimal volume, I can hear a white-noise like hiss. But it’s beneficial to me because I use them to drown out noise. I don’t know if it’s relative to volume of music playback.I’m so impressed with these, I bought a pair to keep in my day trip/carry-on bag so in case I forget my AirPods, I’ve got something and I think I’m going to buy a back-up pair since I doubt they’ll always be 55% off like they are now (April 2022).LATE MAY 2022 UPDATE: The battery life is still great. I get 3 full nights of sleep before they have to be charged. After only 5-6 weeks, the right side only plays at 10% of the volume of the left. This is disappointing but not surprising as all the Bluetooth headphones I buy for sleeping develop this issue. I did buy the back-up pair and will update again when these totally crap out.EARLY JUNE 2022 UPDATE: Both sides crapped out at the beginning of June and despite all my best efforts, both sides only play at 10% volume with my phone cranked up. I’ve called Amazon and they are crediting my account.As mentioned in my review, I bought a back-up pair because they were on sale, and I knew they wouldn’t last forever (although I should have gotten more than 6 weeks). So maybe it was a fluke and I will continue to update.———-ONE YEAR+ LATER———I’ve given up on Sony and have moved onto other brands. I thought they crapped out so soon because I was using them to sleep. But I used my last back-up pair as work headphones. They were only paired to my work computer and only used on my in-office days. This pair still only lasted about 5 months before the volume capacity in one side dropped almost entirely. They’re junk and I will no longer buy.TL;DR DO NOT BUY!!!!!","Reviewed in the United States April 30, 2022",AHTWC36XM3OQHDWCVUG5MQK5RWQA,True,7,Color: White

R2OVDTYAFBLSM2,B07Q8TFRM7,"4.0 out of 5 stars Not perfect, but for the price I can’t complain",Michael Mohr,4,"I bought these because I got my ears pierced and can’t wear my regular headphones.Packaging and presentation is good. I like the idea of the earbuds being connected by a wire so it’s harder to lose and I can wear around my neck like I would headphones. In reality, the wires stick out in kind of a weird way and don’t stay around my neck very consistently, but it’s not a big deal for me. Connecting to my phone and Windows laptops was easy enough.For fit, there are 3 sizes of silicone tips included. I tried the smallest ones but I always have a hard time with silicone tips, they kept falling out. I was able to replace with some foam tips that work a lot better, but this all depends on your ears and preference.For audio quality, the actually sound is pretty good for the price. However, whenever audio is playing I can hear background white noise. When the audio playback stops, it keeps going for 10-20 seconds and then cuts out. It’s not that noticeable when listening to something moderately loud, but can get annoying in calls or classical music with quiet or silent parts.I haven’t used long enough to really test the battery life. Similar to my Sony WH-CH520 headphones, the battery level reported to my phone appears to be tiered rather than exact. But it stayed at “full charge” (above 70%) after a few hours of use, so it doesn’t seem like it will be a problem.","Reviewed in the United States October 4, 2023",AF5TZKGIYOPXY4SAW6KRDE7JIXPQ,True,7,Color: White

I wanted them to stay connected, have some buttons/controls that could be accessed while riding, have good battery power, and -most importantly- for comfortably under the helmet.My only problem is with the connection. If I wear these properly, with the cable behind my head, my connection sometimes drops while riding. It technically connects to my motorcycle, not my phone and I think that signal isn't the strongest. I had other headphones that stayed connected without issue though. My solution is to just wear them with the cable (and receiver) in front of me, but occasionally they blow behind me and connection briefly cuts out sometimes.All else is good though! The button functionally is good (though I wish I could skip songs), the battery holds up phenomenally (2 weeks of daily riding), and I feel no pressure on them from the helmet. Every other headphones pushed against the helmet which hurt my ear after a while. These are so small and lightweight that they fit perfectly. Audio is clear and loud enough to hear perfectly.If these broke I wouldn't hesitate to buy a new pair dive they're better than anything else I tried for this unique purpose.","Reviewed in the United States July 26, 2023",AEN4VHXMEJRQK5JOCT4NVNL24RAQ,True,2,Color: White

It does reconnect itself in about 30 secs or so, but is troublesome especially if you're at work or a public space.The issue seems to be prevalent with the entire series as the issue persists even in the WI-C100 headset.BTW, this does not happen with other bluetooth speakers I use.Also, does happen with other phones, so its definitely a Sony headset issue. Just hoping that Sony fixes it so I get a perfect bluetooth headset.Worst case scenario: You would be listening to your private collection at work, and the headset turns off with the message ""bluetooth disconnected"". But the phone keeps playing the audio on speaker so your co-workers can also listen to your private collection. In about 30 seconds, the headset reconnects with the message ""bluetooth connected"".

I'll skip the typical fluff review and break it down.Battery Life..Amazing! Started listening to podcasts while on a long haul flight. Fell asleep. And 14 hours later, less than 40% charge left.Sound Quality..Flat. And this is a good thing. Headphones should not alter or enhance the sound quality of the music. If your preference is for bass thumping playback, then you should get full-on headphones with larger drivers. Or earphones that have bass enhancing features.USB-C..My smartphone uses USB-C, so I no longer need to bring a micro-USB cable when I travel. One review complained about a proprietary charger plug. Lol. USB-C is an industry standard feature. Even Apple is adopting it.Form factor..I believe the previous generation of these earphones had the mic and controls on one side. I really dislike that type of design. Not only does it look lopsided, but you notice the weight unbalance after wearing it a while. On the WI-C310, it's more symmetrical and comfortable to wear for extended periods of time.Dislikes..- No NFC. I've had other Sony BT earphones in the past and it was so easy to pair to my phone by touching them together. I guess it's not a big deal, if it weren't for the next item.- Can only pair one device at a time. Sometimes I switch music source between my Android phone and an ipod touch. I have to go through the BT pairing process when I want to switch to one from the other.- Flat cables. Not a fan. Makes the cables twist in weird directions. Another reviewer posted selfies and you can see the cables go all over the place.- Weak magnets. I have a pair of Jabra earbuds and the magnets are strong. They snap together by themselves. On the Sony WI-C310, I have to hold each earbud and press them together.- Not water/sweat resistant. This is probably a lot to ask for, considering the low price point. But these would be great in the gym. But then again, for $30 these are practically disposable. Still blows my mind when I see people wear $100+ headphones in the gym and getting them soaked in sweat.Untested..- Phone calls. Considering the placement of the microphone, I'm going to assume the call quality will be mediocre or terrible. Doesn't matter, since I bought these for music playback and long battery life.

RCIAW59Q7O5DD,B07Q8TFRM7,5.0 out of 5 stars These are my favorite headphones of all time!,Katie H.,5,"These are my favorite headphones! They are perfect for tiny ears (when almost nothing else fits comfortably). I can wear these all day and my ears don't get sore at all. The design of the silicone piece that seals or sits in your ear has a small feature that's truly unique (meaning I haven't seen it on ANY other headphone), the opening/hole for sound to travel through (on the silicone part) is more narrow. Making the shape of the ear piece more ovular instead of cylindrical. This makes them FAR more comfortable than any other in-ear headphones I've used. And it does not decrease the sound at all. Just the opposite in fact. The shape creates a better seal when you want them to essentially be ""suction-cupped"" to your ear and makes for a better sound quality. Unfortunately Sony is phasing away from this design, which I think is a huge mistake. These silicone ear pieces are only available on the WI-C310 & WI-C100 (as far as I know).Also, having physically raised plus and minus buttons for adjusting the sound makes a huge difference for me. Being able to feel the buttons makes it so I don't have to look down or use both my hands to pull the piece towards my face to change the volume. I adjust the volume with one hand and quickly. Other headphones without this design waste time. These don't. Sony has moved away from this design in newer models also. Again, this feature is only available on the WI-C310 & WI-C100 (as far as I know).Plus, their battery life is way longer than anything that's 'true wireless' (the individual buds). I have to charge them maybe once every few days, and I use them A LOT (for at least 7 hrs every day). The magnets in the earpiece makes it so they don't fall of your neck when you're just wearing them. I've seen stronger magnets in other headphones, but these do the job.","Reviewed in the United States December 14, 2022",AGKAGGFA6V5UUS5WC2FEBXUUZNMA,True,14,Color: White

Unfortunately, I didn't like these Sony earbuds as much as the cheap ones. First of all, the range was bad. I couldn't even go to the bathroom without them disconnecting, which meant I couldn't listen to music while doing housework unless I kept my phone in my pocket at all times. Also, they constantly fell out of my ears whenever I rode my bike because the wind would catch the ovular bars attached to the cord (the mic and power control buttons), and since there was no way to hook the buds onto my ears, the weight made them impossible to stay put (I honestly wouldn't recommend these for any sort of workouts due to the weighty mic and power controls attached to the cord—they flop around a lot, causing the buds to come out). And for some reason, they would not automatically connect to my devices whenever I turned them on, so I had to manually pair them each time I used them. Lastly, the magnets on the earbuds were weak (so they didn't stick together very well while not in use), which resulted in them falling off of my neck while I was mowing. They got shredded, so I can't attest to how long they would have lasted. Now I'm back to ordering the cheap headphones again. *sigh* I might give Sony another chance with a different style of earbuds in the future, but these were not for me.

The minimum volume these things can put out is just above a whisper, meaning I'm able to drift off to a youtube video or podcast at a comfortable volume without worrying that I'm damaging my hearing. After trying a couple other brands of Bluetooth earbuds, I realized that this is actually a pretty rare feature.My first pair lasted nearly two years before the wire on the right bud frayed and started losing signal.

Because I sometimes use a sleep sound app, I can put one in one ear while I sleep on my other side so as not to disturb my husband. I have 2 tablets (one old, one newer). Older tablet with 2 blue sets are for my basement, the newer tablet and 2 black sets are for upstairs. They fit well and I'm totally satisfied. Two white sets are paired one each for bedroom TV and one for living room TV that way we don't have to put TVs so loud. Love these so much. Tried many others first, didn't fit well, these don't fall out.","Reviewed in the United States February 21, 2023",AEQL5RLQ5TAGFRNPURGH2T2BHW5Q,True,2,Color: Black

Compared to the other earphones that I have had, they are the best but here are my warning notes:- The magnet force to connect the two while around neck on the chest (not in the ears) is kind of weak. As you walk or run, they get dangle around and fall down.- Just like other sets that I have had, the Bluetooth connection may come with parasites and not as solid as the wired sets (not more pronounced than the other sets but the same problem exists here too).- I wish the did not have the rubber thing for the speakers and they had made it in one piece just like Apple's. For some people like myself, these type of rubber-made earphones tend to jump out.- They are better for listening to the music than tele-conferencing.- They are not the best choice for listening to the music when running/exercising.","Reviewed in the United States September 14, 2022",AGNRK6QJE34ZU325XXRSNW4LKRJQ,True,2,Color: Black
R3MBT0M1UDG4QR,B07Q8TFRM7,5.0 out of 5 stars Very good bang for the buck,Real Name,5,"I wanted to get some new bluetooth headphones, but didn't want to spend a fortune, so based on the reviews I gave these a try. I snagged them when they went on sale (as they routinely do) for under 20 bucks and what a deal it turned out to be.The battery life, as most the other reviewers have said, is excellent. The sound is very good for this price point, with crisp highs, well defined mids, and good lows. Some reviews complain about lack of bass. Honestly I think they are wearing the headphones wrong. These certainly aren't ""mega bass"" models but at the same time the bass is fairly pronounced, as long as you have the ear bud in your ear all the way. If you wear it loosely then the bass will be greatly diminished, as with all headphones. The buds come with three sizes of gel covers so you can choose the one that fits your ear perfectly. I ended up using the medium size to get a good seal on my ear and I think the bass level, for my taste at least, is just about perfect.My only minor complaint is that the headphones did not come with some type of clip to keep the connecting wire positioned on your collar without sliding around. I see a third party here sells headphone clips for a few bucks so I may give those a try. Would have been nice if Sony included it though. Some of their older models used to.That aside, these headphone's sound and battery life at this relatively low price point makes them quite a deal in my book.","Reviewed in the United States April 6, 2021",AE7E75WMGLZAX44HXI3PU5E24PUQ,True,2,Color: Blue

R190F81U2CIB3,B07Q8TFRM7,"2.0 out of 5 stars Sound good, but I’m so disappointed by the numerous problems I’ve had with these",E. N.,2,"I’ve been using this brand of headphones for a few years. I usually get them from Target, where they retail for $40 but are often half off. They tend to last for about a year before breaking down, which is pretty reasonable, given how heavily I use headphones. I’ve tried so many types including significantly more expensive ones, and most don’t last beyond 8 months. I also like the sound quality for the price. They aren’t as good as $300 active noise canceling headphones, but work well enough to block most noises. And the sound is actually balanced, which I really appreciate, as I find most headphones are way too bass heavy and sound like trash if you’re trying to listen to something like classical music.Now for the downsides. I’ve never had that many technical problems with the pairs of these I’ve gotten from Target, but the ones I got on Amazon are driving me nuts. They disconnect SO quickly if I’m not using them, that it’s ridiculous. I can pause my music to take a 2 minute phone call, and go back to find they’ve automatically disconnected and I need to reconnect them. Half the time they’ll also automatically shut off too. They often connect to the wrong device, despite me pretty exclusively only using them on one device. And I often find that I need to pair them with that device over and over, which is also pretty annpying and time consuming.The worst is that they’ll often lose the connection while I’m literally using them, with the paired device right next to me. I’ll be in the middle of a song when it suddenly cuts out and stops playing, followed by the noise of my headphones spontaneously disconnecting and then reconnecting for no reason. It’s absolutely INFURIATING and if I ever buy these headphones again, it won’t be from Amazon.","Reviewed in the United States June 12, 2023",AHOZTIBA7IKECHSZK77U2YOUF5PA,True,1,Color: Blue

Some in the reviews complained about the bass, but here it is well audible and quite elastic, in addition, it is here up to 20 hertz, which not all speakers will reproduce. If you don’t hear the bass, it means either you didn’t put earbuds in your ears enough or the earbuds are too small for you. Here you can rather make a claim to high-treble.Once, just a few days after the purchase, I had to reset the settings to the factory ones, since when switching tracks, the headphones simply went silent and had to be turned on and off so that they would work again. After resetting to factory settings, everything was fixed. But if this happens again, then I will lower the score.In general, these headphones are good for listening to music, watching YouTube, movies and for games, but pretty bad for communication.Pros:Good soundGood long chargeQuick connect at startupCharging indicator that goes off when earbuds are chargedConnection indicatorMicro USB Type CA small delay in bluetooth connection, only 215 msCons:Bad microphoneEcho your own voice when talking on the phone or skypeCan only connect to one device at a timeFlimsy wiresNot suitable for sportsSoft buttons","Reviewed in the United States July 18, 2020",AFUHA6BPWJRE6EYDIPIZBLDFYY7A,True,6,Color: White
R3PQXK54LL58X3,B07Q8TFRM7,5.0 out of 5 stars I didn't think I'd ever like Bluetooth headphones!,EB,5,"I tried one set of expensive Bluetooth headphones before and was really unimpressed. The weight wasn't symmetrical so it kept getting pulled and shifted and the earbuds fell out of my ears. I had plug-in headphones I really liked so I didn't feel like wasting money experimenting.I accidentally came across these on Amazon, and since I have my eye on a phone that doesn't have a headphone jack, I decided to try these headphones with my current phone to see if I can live without a headphone jack.And wow! These are fantastic. :D When I wear them behind my neck, the two attachments rest on either side of my neck, and it stays in place because of the equally distributed weight. When I put the earbuds in my ears, the attachments stay resting on the front of my shoulders (collarbone area) so that they don't pull down on the earbuds. Wonderful! I can even wear just one earbud (I prefer doing that when outside so I can be aware of my surroundings) and it won't get pulled or misplaced.A couple of small cons - since the attachment with the mic is resting on my shoulder/collarbone, it can be muffled during a phone call. I just hold it up a little while I talk. Small price to pay for equilibrium and comfort at all other times.And there is a bit of an echo when you talk into the mic like other reviews say, but it doesn't bother me. You hear your own voice at the same time as you are talking, not a second or so after, so it's not bad at all. Others might find it annoying but I don't.Oh, and battery life is amazing! I have it for 3 days now and didn't have to charge. Says ""fully charged"" when I turn it on. I didn't use it heavily (a few phone calls, some mobile games, audio books) but still, I'm surprised the battery is at 100% still.

The first thing I discovered was they muffle the sound too much so that I can't hear people talking to me in person. Easy solution: I just drop one earbud and keep one in my ear (see photo). A piece of velcro wrap around the cords keep them around my neck like a necklace. With that one earbud I can hear my phone calls and operate my phone with the sound controller. I've never had anyone say they are having trouble hearing me like other devices I've used. Now to what saved them from being relegated only to the office. I like to listen to podcasts and audio books throughout the day on my commute. They block out noise enough to easily listen on the bus ride to and from the office. The battery life is phenomenal--one charge easily gets me through two days being continuously on and linked to my phone. They're comfortable. I hardly notice them in my ear even while wearing all day. I don't have much trouble with them falling out. Only if I turn my head and the cord (because of the way I wear them) snags on my collar and pulls them out. Sound quality is great for voice. I haven't really listened to music with them but I don't see why the sound quality would be poor for that. I doubt it would be immersive studio sound. For an inexpensive device that offers all-day wear without battery worries and is great for voice and phone/teleconferencing, these headphones get my highest recommendation.","Reviewed in the United States December 6, 2020",AEBUYGDEGPOODMEYEIWMVM2S2XLA,True,11,Color: Black

They are light weight and comfortable around the neck. The problem is, any slight change in body position could cause the small blocks (battery, control pad) to shift. The middle part of this headset is just a cable and has no structure or weight. It tends to not stay put. So when the pad slips from the front of your neck to the back, it pulls on the ear buds. This is even more true if you only have one ear bud in. I tend to do that since I'm often listening to podcasts and not music and do not need stereo sound.

I don't think ever had them completely die, even after a 13 hour workday... and I'm using them continually. That's almost unheard of, as far as Bluetooth headphones are concerned.I came back to buy a second set (I love them that much that I wanted a second pair) and they were not only still available, but almost $10 cheaper than my original pair.

But if you have both earbuds in I mean obviously you don't have that issue. The sound quality is also better then skull candy, and I personally like the sound quality. The headset for using for calls is iffy, I think it depends on service. Overall I think it is a good affordable choice of Bluetooth headset, and my favorite pair I've ever owned.","Reviewed in the United States September 25, 2021",AFOY7ZG5KQDCCXGVKT6KECTBCLMA,True,0,Color: Blue
R2UFTDFQ5ESV1A,B07Q8TFRM7,4.0 out of 5 stars Good sound & comfort after a couple modifications,Steven Tachell,4,"I'm an audio guy with high end recording equipment and expensive headphones for mixing, but I've always liked sony earbuds for casual listening at a low enough cost that I don't have to be so worried about damage or loss. These have about the same sound quality as the MDREX models I used to buy, and with a couple tweeks I've got them sounding great and staying in place comfortably. First of all, get yourself some Comply T200 memory foam tips, they isolate way better and they improve bass response without needing to buy ""extra bass"" headphones (which I always stay away from). Sub frequencies are definitely audible in these headphones so I see no need for extra bass, I prefer a balanced response. The other tweek I made was to put a little velcro sliding cusp around the two wires, which really helps keep them from sliding off your shoulders or sticking out and getting caught on stuff. You just slide it all the way to end and they easily fit over your head, then you slide it back up under your chin to keep them in place. Would be nice if sony added this feature, but for now this works great.","Reviewed in the United States March 21, 2020",AFA6FJ5X6OSRPFUSKAC3XLU5LHOQ,True,138,Color: Black

I've paired to a Moto G Power, an Asus notebook and a Raspberry Pi 4 all with good results. Battery life is excellent so far. Audio is great for all usage, but this brings up the one flaw in the device that I've noted: when paired with my Moto G there is no audio feedback from the mike to the earbuds so you can't easily hear yourself speak. This feels very awkward; try having a conversation with someone in the room and stick your fingers in your ears every time it's your turn to speak, it's pretty much like that and can make you speak too loudly. Maybe all earbud headsets are like that? I wouldn't know. Callers and a Zoom session I participated in all say my outgoing audio quality is excellent.TLDR: For the nineteen bucks I paid for these they are practically disposable and work great.

I got tired of the wire and the headset started to break down. I wanted something wireless and saw these were on sale. I bought them and had to get IT to connect the Bluetooth, because it was that troublesome. And just to add, I have connected multiple Bluetooth devices to my own phone, my computer and other devices. IT at work comes to ME with questions they can’t solve. I say this to say I’m not some Boomer who doesn’t know how a computer works. Once Bluetooth was connected the mic didn’t work. Again IT had it connected, you saw the volume bar move, but could hear nothing. I took an old set of Skullcandy ear buds and they connected instantly and the speakers and mic worked. So I took Sony ones and said to myself I can keep them as a backup to my AirPods. Well, they didn’t connect to my phone. At this point, I got frustrated and retuned them. Maybe it was a bad set, who knows. I just didn’t need them anymore and they were too much trouble to keep. I will say that I turned the unit on and off and only charged it when I first received them, and the battery life was always full.","Reviewed in the United States February 4, 2023",AHG5EMOY3GK44NTI2BYHMTJES62Q,True,0,Color: Black

My friend who is a proclaimed audiophile recommended this product to me as a replacement. The sound quality is great; noise cancelling is pretty good, so from that perspective I'm happy. The absolute dealbreaker for me is how this set sits on your shoulders (or not). It is just one cord between the ear buds with two little weights that I assume are meant to keep the device balanced as it rests on your shoulders during use, but they do not. The device is practically unusable during weight training as it is constantly falling, pulling, dragging, catching. Even during running the device slips out of balance so frequently and rapidly and I spend so much time readjusting it that a significant portion of my workouts is now dedicated to just maintaining and repositioning this infuriating little device. I've given it three weeks to try wearing it in different styles, different exercises, etc. The only exercise I've found that it stays in place is the stairmaster, where your upper body stays pretty stationary anyway. I think what I need is a device that has a plastic brace to stabilize the cord on my shoulders.

R2UJ1MG65HEOC4,B07Q8TFRM7,3.0 out of 5 stars Basic headphones with great battery life but useless for calls,Trent,3,"These are definitely what I would consider budget headphones from a big name. There's nothing fancy about them and if you just want to listen to music they get the job done. Sound quality is what you'd expect from a $30 set. Battery life is by far the biggest plus, I've been using them for several hours and still says ""fully charged"" on power on. There's two additional sizes of buds included in the box, and USB-C charging and cable is a definite plus in an entry level set. The cable is well weighted as there's a pod at on each side of the neck to stop them from slipping off, and the magnets in the buds are useful but not strong enough to automatically grip when they swing together (you need to use your hands to push them together). They cable is quite long and they do hang quite low, around the top of my ribs. I've not made any calls so can't comment on call quality.Update after 1 month - I still stand by my review for music, however as others have said, these earphones are useless for calls. Audio from the microphone feeds back through the earphones so your surroundings get mixed in with the caller's voice and it also means background noise gets amplified for the person on the other end.

RW595SCVDQR96,B00IT0IHOY,5.0 out of 5 stars Exactly what I was looking for,Rad,5,"I did a lot of research to find headphones that would deliver what I wanted. I'm fairly picky about sound and am very easily bothered if parts of the sound range are artificially boosted or otherwise out of balance. Which describes most of the common headphones that are out there these days with their amplified bass, muddy notes and uneven middles and/or upper notes.Just as a point of comparison, I looked closely at Audio Technica because I had gotten the chance to try two of their models. The sound was a lot better than most, fairly clear and defined overall. Nice. Seemed slightly muddy though on the finer details. And somewhere in the middle range felt a little 'off' to me in ways I don't know how to describe. And parts of the sound profile sounded farther away than other parts. Subtle but it was there. So they were nice in many ways but not quite satisfying for me the longer I listened to them. Additionally, the m50s (the more popular of the two models I tried) had a noticeable amp on the bass which also wasn't quite my speed. Though that's pretty common knowledge about the m50s, so hardly a surprise.I also seriously considered the Sennheiser HD 598 headphones. The reviews are tempting but I just can't have open-back headphones in my current living arrangements. I need at least some ability to shut out noise because of bad neighbors, etc. Even though the 280's are not noise reduction headphones, they do an amazing job of dampening outside noise without any fancy technology. Not only is my music nearly unhearable to anyone sitting in the same room with me, but noises in the room around me are partially blocked out even when I'm wearing my 280's without any sound playing in them. Something to do with how closely they fit I think, seems to automatically dampen some of the noise around me. So they fall somewhere inbetween actual ""noise reduction"" headphones and normal on-ear headphones which block out nothing at all. Seems to be a little more so than other over-ear headphones as well. Overall, that's been nice.I was concerned at first about the 280's since many reviews noted they have a decent clamping fit on the head. I have had huge problems in the past with various on-ear headphones which clamp too hard against my ears and cause physical pain. I knew these were cupping around the ears instead of directly on-ear, but I was still more than a little concerned that this ""clamping"" might be too tight to be comfortable. Thankfully this has proved to fine. When I first put them on, there was a noticeable sense of ""pressure"" on the sides of my head, but not bad enough to be outright uncomfortable or anywhere close to painful. Thankfully within the first 12 hours of use, they seem to have relaxed a bit and now are plenty comfortable to wear for long hours without issue. Occasionally if I don't have them adjusted right, one of the ear pads can end up resting slightly onto of the edge of one ear, which can become uncomfortable hours later. But it's simple to adjust them on my head. Usually happens if I was in a hurry in putting them on and since they are comfortable enough I won't notice for awhile that it wasn't on quite perfectly.As for sound, they've been pretty much exactly what I was looking for. The sound is natural, pretty much like real life. No artificial boosts or drops in parts of the range going from high to low. Sound is nicely crisp and defined, no muddy areas. Holds up when listening to a wide range of genres, from rap to classical, pop to country, acoustic to electronic. Watching movies works fine. The lack of bass boosting is more noticeable on genres that overly rely on the bass being boosted and didn't actually balance their music enough without it. So some rap, some dance, some action movies will have a little less 'umph' to them than you might expect or than they seem to have intended. I count that as a mistake on the original mixer's part though and still prefer to hear what is actually there rather than an overly beefed up version of it which a bass boosting amplified headphone would give me. Plenty of rap and dance music holds up though, so it's really down to whether or not the people who mixed it in the studio did their job correctly or if they had cut corners in the production thinking it wouldn't be noticed. I suspect if I had a portable amp to plug them into, I could get the best of both worlds for those songs and movies where production fell a little short. For me, it doesn't really bother enough to sweat it.The sound on these headphones do feel like it comes from the room around me (even though it isn't actually) rather than the pads on my ears or inside of my head. Again, this headphones have a more natural feel to their sound than anything I've tried before. Some say ""flat"" but I say ""real"" in a way that feels more true to the sound it should be.There is one minor and subtle thing I did notice with these: sometimes I have to fiddle the volume up or down just a slightest hair to get a song to sound at its best balance-wise. I suspect that this is where the fact that these are only a $99 pair and not something higher grade shows. Still, it really isn't bothersome, only just barely noticeable and more than acceptable for a $99 dollar set of headphones. So for a newbie audiophile, these do the job and keep me satisfied. I am sure I will eventually explore higher grade audiophile headphones at higher price points. But for now these are hands down the most satisfying I have found for around $100 with closed backs. Not for bassheads though. If you love a decent sound but still love a bit of bass amp, you should probably choose the Audio Technica m50 over these. If you like an even and more natural sound at this price point, these Sennheiser HD 280 Pro's are worth it and a solid choice. They are exactly what I was looking for and the only ones in this bracket which don't actively bother me. In fact, I can forget it's through headphones and just focus on what I'm doing instead. So just in case any of this helps anyone else who may be pouring over hundreds of reviews trying to imagine what these vs other headphones would be like, just like I was a few months ago. Best of luck on your quest!","Reviewed in the United States January 9, 2017",AEPBU6W4YGG6T4Y4AATG5CWRZHRA,True,156,Style: Old ModelPattern: Headphone
R10IXLXJDA8TOM,B00IT0IHOY,"5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent sound, but . . .",Jordan F Viray,5,"the folks at Sennheiser must not have large heads. As with about every pair of headphones that I try on, I had to extend these all the way to fit. After a few months of daily use, the plastic headband began to develop small cracks. Now the cracks are growing and I fear that the whole thing will just snap one day. Unfortunately, that is one of the parts that isn't listed as replaceable.That said, people who look at this headphone are looking for: a) quality sound synonymous with the name Sennheiser b) excellent noise reduction.a) The sound from these phones is excellent. The standard criteria are there. The signal is very clean, thanks in part to the oxygen free copper cabling used. Bass is controlled and precise so a timpani doesn't sound muffled. Higher frequencies do not hiss and the phones are able to drive high frequency sounds and pull out details lost by consumer grade headphones. Soundstage is fairly narrow as some have said, but much better than consumer sets that sound like the sound source is inside your head. Of course, a DSP solution for soundstage expansion could help if someone didn't like the soundstage.What people should realise is that most music is optimised for listening on a stereo system and not headphones. A search for ""binaural music"" will yield samples that show how music should be sampled for headphones. Anyways, the HD-280 Pros also have 64 Ohms of resistance so an amplifier isn't needed.b) The biggest impression I got from these phones is silence. Not total silence, since with the headphones on I could still hear outside noise. Once the music starts playing, however, music is much clearer because background noises have been attenuated so effectively.That was the biggest attraction of these headphones. For my sound processing work, ambient noise from my computer and the outside world are suppressed admirably. 32 decibels is a lot of sound attenuation, far more than the Active Noise Reduction sets from Bose or even Sennheiser. The HD-280 Pros use passive noise attenuation. This means that for the phones to supress outside noise effectively, they have to be tight. They are very tight in fact. Four Newtons of force are applied, a number significantly larger than most headphones. If it weren't for the thoughtful padding, they would feel as uncomfortable as firing range headsets. Passive noise attenuation also means there is no artifacting from electronic noise that is usually the case in Active Noise Reduction sets.If you have a very large head, a solution is to find in-ear phones (the expensive Etymotics sets have even better sound quality and noise reduction). If you are sensitive to tight headphones, a solution might be the Active Noise Reduction sets (although they aren't as good sonically). If you listen to sound in a very very quiet environment, Grados or some other Sennheisers would probably get you that better soundstage for the money.If none of these situations applies to you, then these phones will provide better sound through their native excellent quality and their superior noise attenuation. After all, the listening experience with Sennheiser 600's on an Audigy 2 card or a tube amplifier is diminished with that noisy computer fan in the background.All in all, these phones are HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.*** UPDATE, October 20, 2009 ***Wow, well these headphones are still ticking after over six years and I'm pretty rough with my equipment! Cheap headphones break after six weeks for me because the cable gets pulled or I mess up the speaker so these Sennheisers are pretty solid.Just as I feared though, the plastic HAS cracked and you can see the thin wires (covered in plastic or rubber) exposed. Now that most of the plastic on the headband has broken off, the fit is quite a bit looser though the headband is still held together by a wide piece of metal. I just wish they would just make a nice metal headband to avoid the plastic cracking issue.While I like the fact that they aren't so tight, I don't like the fact that richness (low-end midrange and bass) suffers because of it. You can simulate this when listening by pulling the headphones slightly apart. It isn't noticeable on light music though and might not be an issue with newer versions of the HD-280 Pro.The ear cushions on my 6+ year headphones are worn past the leatherette, past the foam and to the foam backing layer. The top is looking ratty as well. Replacement ear cushions are around $20.00 which isn't cheap. I'll probably skip that in favor of a new pair of HD-280s - especially if they've been redesigned for larger heads as some people are indicating. I'll keep this pair around as beaters until they quit on me. However, now that I've quieted my working area, sound isolation isn't as critical to me as it was before so I might take a look at other Sennheisers.","Reviewed in the United States February 5, 2003",AFS7CRRYJWF77WIRISUVH4LYJPEQ,True,1295,Style: Old ModelPattern: Headphone
R3PRGP5XTDZWIC,B00IT0IHOY,5.0 out of 5 stars Listen to this...,HPvet,5,"Bought this product for the following applications:1) Playstation 3 GamesPrimarily use these headphones for Rocksmith. Prior to purchase, I was using inexpensive Sony and JVC open headphones which presented two problems. First, the volume was too low when they were directly connected to the Playstation. I could turn up the volume to max on my guitar to hear my own sound but the game music and voice announcements were barely audible. Hooking up the Sennheisers easily doubled the volume, allowing me to turn down the guitar volume which now blends much better with the Rocksmith audios. I also bought an E6 amp which improved the sound slightly but have been usually playing without. Our home is very open with a cathedral loft where I play while my wife reads or watches TV below. The headphones effectively blocked the TV audio.2) iPod 6thGenLike to use my iPod nano and shut out the home noise while listening. These headphones amazed me with their sensitivity and how much volume I could crank out of my teeny nano 6th gen. I have some high frequency hearing loss so I will allow others to comment on the overall performance but I was able to hear things I was missing. For example, Sarah Brightman's vibrato really jumped out at me. It was there before but I had just missed it in the past. Again, although I used the E6 it was unnecessary. However, I'm going to keep it. If I crank the iPod down and the E6 up it should help me extend listening time.3) LaptopOccasionally, I'll plugin while working at the computer although after hearing how great the Sennheisers sound I'll probably be doing it more often. In this application, as well as the above, the coiled cord on these Sennheisers give you nice range and flexibility without the tangles or cords stuck under the desk chair. Volume was acceptable on both laptops I own. Again no need for the E6. However, both PCs have high quality DAC and are marketed as entertainment devices.4) Receiver and CD playerTried both the Sony receiver output and Sony 5 disc player component. Make sure the volume is turned down on the receiver or the Sennheiser's sensitivity is going to blow your ears out. The disc was another matter and if I used this output I would probably need to use the little E6. Come to think of it, I'll have to check the manual and remote on the Sony. There may be volume control.5) GuitarTried a direct plug into my electic since the Sennheisers come with a neat little 1/4 inch adapter. Problem - the adapter is stereo and the guitar is mono so you'll hear only the left channel. Also, the volume isn't loud enough. But pumping it though my little personal guitar mounted amp the sound was plenty loud, and plenty clear, a big improvement over earbuds or open headphones.6) TVPerfect but I'll need a 15 foot extension cord for it to be effective.This is not my first set of closed headphones but in previous units the heat buildup was very uncomfortable. Strangely, these were comfortable for me to wear for an entire day of listening on all these devices and the audio was far superior to the previous ancient Koss headphones I chucked several years ago. In addition, I have a wide head. Opticians never carry lens frames wide enough for me to wear in the sample cases. I was concerned by several reviews that indicated this was an issue but these Sennheisers are adjustable both in width and depth. I could actually adjust them to be comfortably loose at my desk or tighten them to grip firmly while standing and moving with the guitar.I was surprised by the overall value and had expected them to be only acceptable in certain environments, perhaps excelling only with a receiver. The ability to use these in every situation makes this an incredible value. Very happy with my purchase!","Reviewed in the United States January 1, 2012",AG5MXY47KFM7YQTG5XMPJAZWWJHA,True,6,Style: Old ModelPattern: Headphone
R315E5Y0JN99EJ,B00IT0IHOY,4.0 out of 5 stars the real skinny,D. H. Preuss II,4,"These are great if you are not used to reference quality headphones. When I got these I couldn't even conceive of there being better sounding headphones out there. I thought I had the most amazing headphones on the planet. They are rich and present, and fit comfortably.My sales rep at Sweetwater talked me into investing in pair of Beyerdynamics DT 770 pros. He recommended the 770Ms for my front of house mixing (They have better sound isolation than the DT770 Pros and are equivalent to the Sennheiser HD 280s for sound isolation) but I went with the DT 770Pro 250 ohm.Check out the spec sheet on the HD 280s at [...]You'll see that on these cans they don't show you the low end of their frequency response curve because in reality they drop off significantly under 80hz; they have a 5db variation throughout the rest of the sound spectrum. The high lows around 100 hz are accentuated as well as the voices around 1K and the very highs around 10k. Until you listen to headphones that have a really flat frequency response and are truly clear, like the DT770s you don't notice that the HD 280s lack clear low bass response and have really accentuated frequencies throughout the rest of the sound spectrum. What you notice most when comparing side by side is the presence and clarity of the low bass in the DT 770s... which you never realized wasn't there in Sennheisers until you listened to the better cans. The DTs are much clearer, much flatter. After listening through the reference cans the HD 280s don't sound clear, and the gain in the 100 and 1K areas is really, really evident.but we're not comparing apples with apples. The DT770 Pros cost about 3 times as much.Here is why you would buy the HD 280s: They are amazingly versatile and a great DJ or front of house headphone. Because of how they fold and articulate you can grab them by the right can, swivel it outwards and put it to your ear in one sweep... that means if you need to monitor a channel in your mix NOW you can with one hand in under a second. They are great for this. You don't need to use both hands and place them over your head to monitor with them. I leave them plugged into my soundboard always when I am mixing live because they are so quick to grab and monitor with.You would buy these if you are a drummer. Our drummers love them. They isolate very good and play loud. They are comfortable and stay put. I never see our drummers fussing with them or adjusting them. They put them on and play. And these headphones are very, very, very durable and tough. Our drummers are animals with equipment. The cord on these has been stretched out for all it's worth, the headphones have been abused terribly and played extremely hard, a lot! After a year or so the pads are still in excellent condition, the head band works like new and they play perfectly. And they just keep going like the day we got them.You would buy these if you only had limited funds and have never listened to studio grade headphones and don't plan to in the near future. I was skeptical of a salesman trying to sell me an expensive set of cans when he recommended the Beyerdynamics. This isn't to say the Beyerdynamics are better than Sennheisers, I haven't tried the high end Sennheisers to compare. But, my salesman said very sincerely that the DT770s were worth the money. They are. I like the 250 ohm DT770 Pros a lot. They are almost too clear to mix with... everything sounds good in them. Using an optical link between my computer and stereo listening with the DT770s is an incredible experience.If I was a drummer I would buy these and never need another pair of anything.I would buy them if I was a DJ. They isolate great and are plenty loud, and the things you need to hear stand out perfectly in a noisy environment.For front of house monitoring I would definitely recommend them. I've let other sound guys use these for mixing live and they are in love with these headphones!But, being a sound engineer who records and edits music... even if I had unlimited funds to spend on a set of cans, though I would buy these first for their versatility, I couldn't own just them for their sound quality because of the fact that I master with my headphones. I don't even listen to HD280s if the DT770s are within reach. Truthfully, compared to the DT770s they sound terrible. But compared to nothing... they do sound great.","Reviewed in the United States March 28, 2010",AG5IJZSS6AR5WICQDFBLP7JGHHDA,True,11,Style: Old ModelPattern: Headphone
R1QHULAFQPARZR,B00IT0IHOY,"5.0 out of 5 stars Good quality comfortable ""over the ear"" headphones.",Core,5,"I had another pair of Sennheiser Headphones that I had bought, that lasted for quite awhile, years, and pretty good quality. So I decided to pick up another set and up-scale a bit as far as quality goes. The fact that these were on-sale when my others conked out on me finally helped move my choice along.Anyways I'm not an ""audiophile"", bless those individuals hearts.. But I do appreciate comfort and clear sound just like anyone. And these headphones definitely deliver that. I suppose there is a bit of a 'break in' period.. when your first wearing them, but after a little usage.. listening to tunes and watching streaming media.. the headphones loosen up a hair, where they start becoming more comfortable.As far as ""Over the ear headphones"" these do a really good job of cutting out background noise. Especially when your actually listening to something on them. I can sit right next to my TV and have the sound cranked up, and it will sound muffled with these on. Take them off and its like being shouted at though.My setup for these, is directly plugged into my laptop. No special software to tweak the sound, no amp.. nothing like that. Just all the basic stuff and these work really well. I can imagine if you were more of hard core individual when it comes to audio and had a more technical set up, that these headphones would deliver for you.*Update* So I ordered these on ""Ordered on April 9, 2015 "" Everything is continuing to hold together, So its been about 3 years. They've paid for themselves a few times over now. The only thing is, the padded headband (This is the old model design as far as I can tell that I bought) is starting to flake. Ironically the over ear part, the faux leather is still holding on and in good shape. Surprised at this. Still sound great.*Update* October 30, 2019 So I have had these things for 4 years Now. And they've just REALLY started to fall apart. Like the right padding on the headset, just.. kinda *pop* like it was magic.. came lose.So it's been a good run, but I'll probably have to buy another pair of these, or something really similar.*Update* June 2020 Not sure why, b/c usage is limited to my pc. And while I listen to music & watch video, frequently, I have been gentle with my new headset 'The newer design' anyways, the HD280 Pro just developed a short, in the right speaker for some reason? I'm going to attempt to check it out and see if I can fix it, because I'm past the warranty period since I purchased the new.This is really frustrating. I've literally had them less than a year. Since I ordered them in October 2019. If I hadn't had such good experience with the other headsets of this brand, it would be a bad deal.I'd rate this new headset 1 star out of 5, for this garbage.*Update* SO after some frustration of trying to figure out how the new design was assembled in such a streamlined manner, I got the right speaker out of its cradle, and dissembled the unit, and fiddling with the wire...WHILE LISTENING TO IT, I could get the audio to come back through. I think during themanufacturing process, the way the wire was plumbed in, it got pinched in such a manner, that it was readyto break, and then after usage for awhile, it just broke completely.Even though I've had the headset since October 2019 to, today, that's 9 months, but I may have only used the unitfor 30 days, solid time.The good news is I may be able to fix this. I don't really want to.*Update* Good news went south real quick. The manufacturing process of the wires, leading to the speaker, are designed in an interesting way.. They have fiber mixed it. The wires, are HORRIBLY small.. like, it's so little copper, that, well basically I couldn't fix my Sennheiser HD280PRO Headphones (New Design) Also of note, when leaving a review, even though I'm doing this under the ""New design"" its still registering for the old one.","Reviewed in the United States July 11, 2015",AHK7VL5VIL3PW4BOD7L74LICAWCA,True,6,Style: Old ModelPattern: Headphone
R3JS4HX56M91K1,B00IT0IHOY,5.0 out of 5 stars The best headphones I have ever tried.,pk,5,"I have owned these phones for over a year now, and I love them so much, it has prompted me to write my first Amazon review!As a basis for this review, the following helps set the context:1. I listen to music mostly using Windows Media Player from my computer, with absolutely none of the special effects - no SRS, no equalizer, nothing. Just direct playback.2. I listen approximately 5 hours every day.I have organized this review into various sections that I particularly care for in a set of headphones.1. Channel separation: This hasn't been mentioned in any of the other reviews, so I am unsure if it is just me. But I have never observed such accurate channel separation in any set of headphones I have tried before (see down the review for a list of my headphones)! It is truly a concert feeling - every distinct note, vocal or beat seems come from a specific place, pure left, pure right, somewhere deep, etc - exactly where it is meant to come from, almost like I was listening to true 5.1 channel music! It is not all bundled up in the center of the head. For instance, listen to ""Wish you were here"" by Pink Floyd. I never knew before putting these phones on that almost the entire 1st minute of the music (the background tv, the muffled guitaring) is entirely on the right channel, and only the breaths, coughs etc are on both channels! Listen to ""Mrs. Robinson"" by Simon & Garfunkel. The base guitar is on the right channel. The lead guitar starts on the left and slowly moves towards center. It is amazing! I notice this of so many songs, I want to listen to them all over again!2. Fidelity: This is truly a killer. The artist's breath, every stretch or pluck of the guitar string, every hiss or static in old jazz recordings, pretty much everything can be heard! Some may say why would I want to hear the static/hiss/breath etc? Well, I like to! It makes me feel I am sitting right there where the music is being performed. And if the music contains these sounds, I like it that these headphones can reproduce them faithfully. Artificial noise level is practically absent, even when the volume is turned up.3. Frequency range: These sets do loose a bit of audio detail at both ends - very low and very high. However, it is not significant enough to bother me. The thing that I really like is that the response is even across most of the range. To help explain what I am saying, if you play the entire octave from lower C to higher C with the same intensity, the loudness of each of the notes would be fairly similar. Not just the evenness of the range, the tones across the entire frequency range are accurate. The thing that I didn't like about the Bose Quiet Comfort headphones is that they seem to artificially boost the amplitude at the lower end, seemingly to compensate for the active noise-cancelling eating away some of the actual audio detail. That made them sound with more ""bass effect"" than actually present in the music. If I need more bass, I'll use equalizers, I don't want my headphones to make that decision.4. Noise suppression: If you want numbers, these sets reduce noise by 32dB without using any active noise-cancellation circuitry! And that is really, really good! I personally have tried noise-cancelling headphones and don't like them because they some how can't get the low frequencies right. But try these on and you really understand what noise suppression these have! In office, my door is open and I don't hear any ambient noise when the music is playing. My colleagues knock and I don't hear them! Many times they literally have had to come and tap my shoulder! And being sealed headphones, they don't leak too much music outside the cups, so you can comfortably share the room with someone without disturbing the person.5. Comfort: When I first started using these headphones, they did seem a bit tight around my big head. Every hour or so, I would take them off and rest my head a bit. However, over time they have loosened up a bit. Now I can go for hours without taking them off. And Sennheiser did a wise thing by putting soft and cushy leather pads on the cups, which not only help with comfort, but also help with noise suppression.The best part of these headphones is that they get better over time! This was truly a discovery, and the main reason I was prompted to write this review! I don't know what it is, but the phones have actually gotten better over time. May be the diaphragms have opened up a bit to reproduce even the finest detail. And maybe the comfort has increased since they have become a bit looser. But after approximately putting 2000 hours on these headphones, they sound better than new!Other things to consider:Portability: Yes these headphones fold, but I wouldn't classify them as fully portable. If you care for portability, you might be interested in the Etymotic 6 series - slightly pricier than these but similar features (including great passive noise suppression), and they are ear-bud design and hence completely portable.Case: These headphones don't come with a case. If you plan to move around with them a lot, you would definitely want to invest in a sturdy case for it. I chanced upon the Lowepro Ex 120 Camera Bag, which seems perfect for these. The folded phones fit snugly, and it has a small pouch in front for my pocket pc (which doubles up as my music player). Being a camera bag, it has enough padding on it to protect both the PDA and headphone.To sum it up:At under $100, these headphones simply can't be beat. I am getting another one for myself for home so that I don't have to haul my current one around.Other headphones I have tried/own:Bose Quiet Comfort 2 noise-cancelling setSennheiser PXC 250 noise-cancelling setSome Sony stuff not worth mentioning in polite company!","Reviewed in the United States November 1, 2006",AGMO45S3OSQJMLNEP3U3HMTGTNQA,True,252,Style: Old ModelPattern: Headphone

R17X06UD2KHZFS,B00IT0IHOY,5.0 out of 5 stars Best Headphones Available in This Pricerange,I am trying to help you.,5,"I am a professional audio engineer in film and music. I was looking for affordable headphones for personal listening while traveling, that could also be used for work in the studio and in the field. I purchased the HD-280's after several months of research, and I am extremely happy with my purchase... so much so that I will be outfitting the studio with several more pairs.Most of the headphones I own are for ""professional"" application, and thus require more power to drive the speakers. At 64 ohms, these cans are easily driven by my iPod and sound great without requiring a headphone amp.There are a lot of reviews regarding the sound of these phones, so I'm not going to spend a lot of time on audio ""flavor."" The HD-280's are nice and flat --minimal audio coloring, which makes them perfect for a studio tracking situation. There is plenty of bass, but they aren't bass heavy. After a lot of research, I don't think there is a pair of headphones out there that can stand up to the ""true"" audio quality of these phones at this price point. They could be used for mixing in a pinch, though I will always use a higher quality (more expensive) set of headphones for mixing (I rarely mix with headphones, but for reference, when I do I use Beyerdynamic DT 770 PRO, 250 ohms .For tracking, the HD-280 can't be beat. And at under one hundred dollars, there is no question that these are the most affordable, quality option for outfitting a studio. However, even if I had unlimited money, I can't imagine purchasing anything but these in quantity. The attenuation is fantastic (they are tight to the user's head and leak almost no audio), and I get little to no audio bleed even when tracking super-close vocals. While they *can* take a lot of abuse, at this price, they are practically disposable (even though the ear pads, cord, and headband pad are easily replaced), so I don't have to get so testy with the jack*ss lead guitar player tossing them on the floor after a session. :-DBecause of this fantastic attenuation, we will also be using these to record audio in the field for film and video applications. I first received these while on vacation, and I was actually using them NOT PLUGGED IN to simply create silence. They are on par with the ANSI ear protection I use while working in the woodshop.The coiled cord will keep the cord alive longer, but it is a little annoying because of its weight. If one is not careful, they will also tangle more easily than a straight cord. I will likely explore options for a straight cord, especially when using these while traveling.The cord is made to be easily changed, and the included instruction manual has clear and specific instructions for how to do this. However, it's not as easy as simply unscrewing or unplugging the cord (my Beyer-Dynamic DT-150's simply have a six pin connector); you need to take apart the housing of the left speaker and unplug the cord from the inside. There is no soldering involved (the end of cord plugs into a spot on the inner board), and the entire process should only take a couple of minutes.There seems to be a lot of disagreement as to whether these phones are ""comfortable"" or not. I chose to ignore the people complaining that they were uncomfortable, even painful, after about an hour of use and decided to take a gamble. Due to the tight compression of the pads against the head, the complainers were right. While I don't think my ears stick out abnormally far, I do find that the inside of the headphones (the speakers) press up against the top of my ears, so I do need to take a break every once in a while. I would say this is simply the price of such a tight seal against the head (and worth the trade). It's actually also a good ""timing device"" to remind the user to take a break every once in a while; when they start to get uncomfortable, it's probably time to give your eardrums a break anyway.I may eventually have to purchase ""personal travelers"" that are a little more comfortable (lighter, less pressure on my ear tops) and portable (these are pretty heavy and fairly large), but for now these are making me happy --I just have to give my ears a chance to breathe a little more often. Perhaps the ""in-ear"" options can never be beat for this reason (weight and comfort).The padding is leatherette (like all of my Beyer-Dynamics) and will likely need to be replaced after a couple of years, but due to the popularity of these headphones the replacement pads are readily available (have been for years, and likely will be for many years to come). The padding for the headband is made of the same material, and also readily available. There is a ""Ziploc"" type fastening system that runs the length of the entire headband (on top) for easy and secure fastening.I love that the speakers are rotatable 90 degrees. They lay flat on the table when you set them down, and you can solo one side or the other (though they don't flip 180 degrees as some reviewers have suggested so you have to pull them away from your head a good deal to do this).While they don't get ""tiny,"" its nice that these full-size headphones can collapse to about the size of a 750ml bottle of Crown Royal (though I prefer Pappy Van Winkle bourbon).","Reviewed in the United States December 29, 2012",AH7R2XPWHAAHRHO3KZAZ7M3JASXQ,True,30,Style: Old ModelPattern: Headphone
R10G3GLKXKWDUX,B00IT0IHOY,5.0 out of 5 stars Top value $100 headphones,David,5,"A couple weeks in and I have finally ""broken in"" these headphones.Going from headsets that didn't have proper passive noise-cancelling to these took a few days of getting used to; As some negative reviews have described, I did feel a literal pressure on my eardrums completely independent from the pressure the headphones themselves were putting on my head. But, after 24+ hours of active time with them on and with the following adjustments, I have yet to experience this discomfort again.My number one advice is to max out the length on these for the best experience. Adjusting the band to fit to your head causes a constant pressure on the skull that I could see causing headaches if left long enough. Maxing out the band such that the pads do most of the work and the headphones themselves ""fall"" onto your head FIXES this problem and give off mild pressure that your brain will tune out within minutes.I have now worn these for 9+ hour periods at a time with NO pain. In some cases the pads may put pressure on the ear cartilage which can be solved by adjusting them.The sound is just as everyone says; These are headphones good enough for studio use; You can hear tracks exactly as they were heard in the recording booth. The audio is clean and full with what I would consider a perceived equal balance from lows to highs.This may mean that if you're looking for warmer headphones with more bass these are not the ones for you. Bass can be heard very distinctly but will never have that domineering punch or warmth that some may be looking for.The CABLE may be a problem for those with small desks or setups that do not allow for the coil to rest on a flat surface. To avoid these problems position the cable so that it can rest on a desk as you use it, this way it won't weigh on you or generate noise when rubbing against things. The coil is so massive that you could walk across 2 bedrooms with it so distance really isn't a concern.","Reviewed in the United States July 7, 2024",AGIL4FV26E47UOJL5QUJXZNEBP7Q,True,0,Style: New ModelPattern: Headphone
R1QOTLVLH9CVCN,B00IT0IHOY,5.0 out of 5 stars VERY Happy !,GMA559,5,"I bought my first set of what I considered ""Good"" headphones from Radio Shack in [probably} 1977 or '78, and believe it or not, they lasted me (I tend to take care of things) for at least 30 years. I've only had one other set since (Sony) which did ok for many years, but quality of manufacturing and 'planned obsolescence' was certainly present, albeit the sound quality was ok.These (Sennheiser HD 280) are the first 'nice' set I've had since then. It took me this long to justify spending the money on myself. I can say I'm Very Happy with my decision. I tend to over-research my purchases to the point that I just end up putting off buying anything after reading the reviews, because someone is always being a 'moaning Marvin' - but this time I just bit the bullet and took the chance. I've known the Sennheiser name since the 80's from my audiophile friends, but never thought I'd have the chance to own such nice equipment. I'm SOOOO glad I bought these! My 'go to' track for testing (since the mid 1980's) has been ""Brothers in Arms"" from the Dire Straits album of the same name. The resonating bass and crisp highs aren't always easy to discern without the right equipment. These headphone are DEFINITELY the right equipment! Every note and tone comes through effortlessly - and that's off a mid range laptop!! I can't wait to finally set up my mothballed direct drive turntable and hear the album on my home receiver!!Since, like I said, I take care of stuff, I'm hoping I won't experience the decaying pad covering issues [brought up by some reviewers] in the future - but even if I do this venture will still have been worth it, as these are probably the last set of headphones I'll ever need.","Reviewed in the United States April 25, 2024",AGDKD4GAQ2T4DCQQC3RKQE7QWKZQ,True,0,Style: New ModelPattern: Headphone
RDUVXW12NMK8H,B00IT0IHOY,"5.0 out of 5 stars Incredible sound, long life - Updated December 2015",J. Penrose,5,"I've had a pair of these beasts for more than two years now and I've never had a better set of 'phones sonically.Like a number of other people, I find the plastic cover of the headband is cracking and shedding pieces to the point now where it looks like I use the headphones to drive nails.Apparently the outer shell just does not flex enough and I do have a somewhat larger than average head. It's annoying and looks awful but until they actually fall apart I'll keep using them and then will probably buy another set.Sonically, they are simply incredible. I use a small portable CD player and it drives them just fine, even on battery power.The noise isolation is wonderful, I use these on airplane trips and most of the noise just vanishes, at home, I often don't hear the telephone ringing on the end table next to me and I don't listen to particularly loud music. I can enjoy quiet music while my wife watches TV 6' away and barely register that it is on.Every time I play a CD for the first time using these 'phones, I am usually astounded, especially if I've heard the music before on lesser systems. It's like hearing it for the first time. The depth and clarity simply delight me and I am constantly hearing new things or nuances in the music, even on discs I have heard a hundred times before.The bass is full and rich without sounding like you've plugged your speakers directly into a 60hz AC outlet. (Which seems to be a popular thing to do judging from what some people call ""bass"" but which is more like the sound made when a brontosauraus has really bad gas.) Highs are crisp and clear without sounding tinny or ringing and the soundstage is just right at least for me.I use these primarily for classical, jazz and new age/ambient with occasional excursions into classic rock and they just simply work. I can't comment on how they sound with ""rap"" or similar noise as I only use these to listen to real music, not someone screaming vulgar words while thumping on a bass drum, but I digress.If you want quality sound with great isolation, buy these, just don't wear them while bicycling or driving, OK? You won't hear the semi-truck coming through your windshield.;)Update: In late 2007 I bought another pair of these. I think they may have solved the cracking headband issue. I use them almost daily often for two or three hours at a time and the new set does not seem to be showing any signs of the older pair's issues. Sound quality is still the best I've heard, especially for the money. They are heavy and a bit hot and the cups could be a bit deeper...they press on my ears a bit after long wear but I've yet to find anything else I like as much.Update to the update: July 2009. Still use them heavily almost every day. Headband is fine, no noticeable wear, cracking or other issues. I think Sennheiser listened to people.Buy these 'phones! I've used them now with almost every decent portable music player around, my PC and my stereo. They just sound good and they keep sounding good.Update cubed - Late May 2011 Still using the same 'phones. No cracking of headband, no loss of quality. Only noticeable degradation is that the ear cushions have gotten a bit squishy. I think they are user replaceable. I wear these things a good ten hours a week. I really cannot say enough good things about this product. There are still companies that know how to make a quality product and offer it at a fair price.Update the 4th - Late in 2012, the ear cushions pretty much gave up the ghost and these things became very uncomfortable to wear.I was going to pitch them and get something newer when I ran a cross a ""how to"" video from Sennheiser on how to replace the ear cushions. Turns out to be reasonably easy...watch the video a couple of times as the tech kind of gets his hands in the way in a critical shot or two. You don't need any tools, just some patience and a willingness to stretch the cushions farther than you think they will stretch.So, I located a (non-Amazom, they didn't have them) source, ordered a set of cushions and once I got them installed (maybe ten minutes work and some cursing as this kind of manual dexterity has never been my long suit), I now have a practically new set of phones that just keep on working. The headband cushion could use replacing but it's not critical so I am not going to bother. Cost of the ear cushions was in the mid $20 range, so if they last as long as the original set (and they feel of similar quality, I should be updating this in another four or five years. :0Update the Fifth - End of December. 2015 Replacement ear pads have held up nicely. All aspects of the headphone are fine except the strain relief connection where the cord joins the plug has frayed away and it only hangs on by the actual wiring and I expect that to go sooner rather than later and it is NOT user replaceable.That will end my long and lovely relationship with these 'phones.I find I rarely use them now as I obtained a gorgeous pair of Phillips Fidelio headphones earlier in 2015 and they just keep growing on me for any use that does not require the solid sound isolation these provide.But I have gotten more than my money's worth out of the Sennheisers. Highly recommended.","Reviewed in the United States April 4, 2005",AFOYBXZA6UK4YT32LKYCZLCQG3VQ,True,34,Style: Old ModelPattern: Headphone

I'm overall pleased with my purchase. The sound quality is great. I have a small head, so these fit me fairly well, but if you have a larger hat size, these may be tough to wear for extended periods of time. The headphones clamp tightly to one's head as opposed to sit atop, if that makes sense. The ear cups are also small, so if you frequently draw comparisons to Dumbo, these may not be for you. One last small con is that the ear cups are loose and twist easily. I have absent-mindedly picked them up and pinched my fingers as a result numerous times, so be careful how you handle them.","Reviewed in the United States May 31, 2024",AGGPROYDQUMWZJ24DEFUFCZA3J3Q,True,0,Style: New ModelPattern: Headphone

R2FWVAGKAGEQXX,B00IT0IHOY,"4.0 out of 5 stars A Recent review for people wondering, is this headset still relevant?",Kyle,4,"When I was looking for a great set of headphones, the first thing i did was go to cnet.com and see what their highest rated headphones were. This pair won the editors choice award back in 2004 and had a 4 star rating from both the experts and consumers.So next i went and looked here on amazon and looked at the customer reviews. they were very positive for the most part, but the most recent review was two years old. my question was, are these headphones still relevant even though they have been on the market so long?I just got them in the mail today, and I would have to say yes. Im no audiophile, but i do like a good quality headphone. I have a pair of klipsch s4's and they offer an amazing sound for the 80 dollar price tag. I used to own a pair of bose triport over the ear headphones that put me back 130 bucks, and those lasted me a good 8 years. I wouldnt say i have an extensive knowledge of the market or anything or of high quality headphones, but i am interested in a quality listening experience.My first impressions were that the headphones seemed like a very sturdy build. I have read about plastic cracking and so on, I will have to keep an eye out for that. Them seem to be high quality and very sturdy. They are fairly large and bulky, although if you are looking at over the ear headphones thats probably not necessarily a concern to you. the cord seems thick and sturdy.The leather is comfortable, but a little stiff. im sure this will change with use.a couple things i did not expect is that the headphones did not block out as much sound as i thought they would. When i wore them and turned on music i could hardly hear anything outside of my headphones, but while wearing them without music on i could hear plenty of outside noise. on the other hand, when my wife put them on and she turned on music, there was a lot of music bleeding from the phones. I could very cleary hear what she was listening to, so if that is a concern, these may not be for you.The audio was very good. Ive heard lots of people say the bass was lacking, and I have to say these had plenty of bass for me. im sure thats all relative to what you listen to and enjoy, but the bass was very good. I did have to turn up the volume a decent amount to really get the bass bumpin though. overall the whole sound of the headphones was very good. Im not sure how they compare to other headsets, but i was very pleased with the sound.I plugged them into my hd yamaha audio receiver and watched a show. it seemed to work very well. Then i played dead space 2 with them on my ps3. It was doing 5.1 surround sound, and i was seriously getting creeped out. my wife walked up behind me and when she touched my leg (i didnt hear her walk up) i jumped really bad i was so drawn into the experience.overall they seem like a very good product for the $96 i paid. so heres the rundown on what i thoughtPros:Great sound, great basscomfortablesturdywhen music is playing couldnt hear outside noise$96Cons:bulkybleeds sound like crazy (people sitting next to you will hear everything)didnt block outside sound much when silentyou could likely be just as happy with another headset, youll just probably pay more for thoseThere are much more comfortable headphones out there. these are doable, but after a while my head began to hurtDo i recommend these? yeah, if you are looking for a decent over the ear headset for less than $100, these may be for you. if you are looking for portability, these are probably not for you. However, I would say that if you can, try out some other headphones and see what you think. I really loved my bose headphones, and those were nice because they had wonderful sound, more portability and a little more stylish. So i would recommend these, but then again i wouldnt say these are the it and all of headphones. if you are on the fence, check out some others. these may not be for you. I like these pretty well but im sure i would have been just as happy with another headset, but those will likely be over $100.","Reviewed in the United States February 18, 2011",AESMD3XJTIK43GKNQEVYVYGRZHEQ,True,3,Style: Old ModelPattern: Headphone
R2DDBKJLTXCR38,B00IT0IHOY,5.0 out of 5 stars Comfortable. Big. Price good. May need to keep cord harnessed.,Alonzo Hosford,5,"Bought these for a dopy open office conversion done in the worse possible way. These along with worlds finest ear plugs and the Rain app on my iPad playing under music, the extremely disruptive office sounds disappeared.By itself, the office sounds still came in but it was better than most.Its over the ear so you will find it comfortable for longer.The substantial cord is coiled and unless you harness it, you will hear it rub against say the edge of your desk. Not hard to do, just need to plan a bit and you can achieve that without a physical harness. At first I though it was part of the disruptive office noise, but soon learned it was the cord and with adjustments, that went away.Items like ear covers and head sleeve are replaceable so if you are rough with it say in a studio or where you are constantly taking on and off, you can replace those.I am not a sound expert but I did notice what they say about it getting better after use.I like its comfort.I also have a big head (always have those caps with the adjuster on the last fastener or millimeter of strap) so that was a factor in buying. Fits nicely with room to spare and can be adjusted to fit smaller heads.It is ostentatious so it looks like you are an audio engineer. But who cares as it does a good job.I since left the open office because of it and working in a better environment. I plan to use this with computer video and audio editing because it is better. Also I will definitely take them on airplanes. With these babies and the worlds finest ear plugs, a crying baby next to you may very likely not be heard if you have some decent background sound.Finally the price for what you get is a deal for what you get. Look at Bowes headphone prices and reviews and you will be out another $100 or so for something less comfortable and not doing much different or even less so of acheive the holy grail of external noise suppression.[Update 1/22/14]Warning if you need to replace the cord, you can easily break the internal soldered wires. Cheap wires and even cheaper solder. Get the manual first and there is a guide on how to do it which I will give a grade of C-. But the key item there is only take out one screw nearest to where the cord comes in after you remove the ear muff. And then still be careful. I removed both screws because my first internet searches failed to find directions and the replacement cord comes without them. Leave the old cord connected until you get the replacement so you can see how it goes back together. The diagrams are useless in that regard. Basically you will be connecting to a circuit board the size of a 1/2 postage stamp and becomes loose once the necessary screw is removed to get the cover off to see it. The circuit board has delicate wires to each ear phone and there is not much wiggle room to get the heavy duty pins to the cord out and in without providing a lot of stress on those wires. For near $35 for the replacement cord, might as well get a new set for $89. But if you want to try to replace it, search in Google ""Sennheiser Replacement Connection Cable for HD 280"" and look for the pdf which has the instructions as well as suppliers. Amazon does not have a supplier of the replacement cord when I looked.Second warning: I slightly bent the jack on a plane ride. Stupid airlines have the jack perpendicular to the arm where your leg touches it. Never the less it still worked in my iPad for the remainder of my trip but inserting and removing lost its clean feel. But when I went to plug into my Mac it was a bit more rough going in and I did not want to stress the Mac audio port. Probably should have left it alone, but I tried careful to straighten it out. Well the jack head basically came apart like cheap tin foil wrapper. So the two warnings are telling you this cord although heavy duty has some fragility to it.","Reviewed in the United States January 27, 2013",AGIFFJ36FT6NW73NZMD4OT675NXA,True,1,Style: Old ModelPattern: Headphone
R1OJA4JN7LB0FP,B00IT0IHOY,5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing quality and comfort.,Mark K.,5,"The Sennheiser HD 280 PRO is a pair of over-ear monitoring headphones designed for professional audio applications. These headphones are known for their robust construction, sound isolation, and accurate audio reproduction. Here are some key features and characteristics of the Sennheiser HD 280 PRO headphones:1. **Closed-Back Design:** The HD 280 PRO headphones feature a closed-back design, which helps to isolate external noise and prevent sound leakage. This makes them suitable for monitoring and recording situations where accurate sound reproduction and isolation are important.2. **Sound Isolation:** The closed-back design, along with padded ear cups, provides significant passive noise isolation. This is beneficial for critical listening and monitoring, as it helps to eliminate distractions from external noise.3. **Accurate Sound Reproduction:** These headphones are designed to provide a relatively flat and accurate frequency response. This means that they strive to reproduce audio as faithfully as possible, without overly emphasizing or de-emphasizing specific frequencies.4. **Rotatable Ear Cups:** The ear cups of the HD 280 PRO can be rotated for convenient storage and single-ear monitoring. This feature is useful for DJs, studio engineers, and musicians who need to monitor audio in various situations.5. **Comfortable Fit:** The headphones feature padded ear cushions and an adjustable headband to provide comfort during extended listening sessions.6. **Durable Construction:** The HD 280 PRO headphones are built with durability in mind. The materials used are robust, making them suitable for both studio and on-the-go use.7. **Foldable Design:** The headphones can be folded for compact storage and transport, making them convenient for professionals who need to carry them to different locations.8. **Replaceable Parts:** Sennheiser offers replaceable parts for the HD 280 PRO, which can extend the lifespan of the headphones. Users can easily replace components like ear cushions and headband padding.9. **Detachable Cable:** The headphones come with a detachable coiled cable, which can be useful in different studio setups. The cable is terminated with a 3.5mm jack and comes with a 1/4-inch adapter.10. **Professional Applications:** The HD 280 PRO headphones are often used by audio professionals, including musicians, sound engineers, and producers, for monitoring and mixing tasks in recording studios, live sound environments, and other audio-related settings.It's worth noting that while the HD 280 PRO headphones have been popular and well-regarded, newer models and alternatives from Sennheiser and other manufacturers might have been released since my last knowledge update in September 2021. Always check for the latest information and reviews before making a purchase decision.","Reviewed in the United States August 24, 2023",AE7LIFO43UYYJLL7OKD4JYSEM2MA,True,14,Style: New ModelPattern: Headphone
R23063X6TRYLF0,B00IT0IHOY,3.0 out of 5 stars I had high hopes,Brad,3,"I want to start by stating that I do not claim to be an audiophile, I am not a sound engineer or even a musician. I am just a guy looking for a comfortable pair of closed-can headphones for recording my amateur podcast that will ideally be versatile enough that I don't need multiple pairs for different activities.This particular model of headphones came highly referred to me. My friend who is an audiophile first recommended them, my friend who is a part-time paid voice actor uses them, my friend who is a musician said his studio has them, and my friend in radio said their station only has these models. With that amount of praise, I couldn't wait to use them.The headphones themself are a really thick hard plastic that while they don't look or feel as high-quality as some that are made with metal and leather, they exude a feel of durableness that they're known for. They have kind of a cool aesthetic to their clunky design.The bungee cable is hardwired in, which means that you don't have to worry about accidentally yanking it out, but if the cable becomes damaged (which is typically the first thing to go out on headphones) then you either have to throw them out or perform surgery. The cable has a nice heft though, with a thick enough coating that it feels durable, and while it has a decent stretch to it, the cable is on the shorter end.The band adjusts just big enough for me to wear it with a hat on, but I'm not sure if it's enough to be comfortable because I find the padding on the band incredibly uncomfortable. Similar to other Sennheiser headbands, there are bulging pads on each side of your crown that create pressure points on your head. Similarly, they have significant clamp force that would require me to leave them on a pillow over 1-2 nights in hops to spare my skull from their Mountain-like grasp.The cup pads are the most comfortable part of this headset, with a decent cushion, however I was not able to test comfort over an extended period of time because I found the band too uncomfortable to really use these headphones. I do have a larger than average head (hat size is 7 5/8 and glasses are 130mm wide) and my smaller headed friends have used their own pair of these for hours at a time without complaint. Although my wife who is averagely sized for a woman said she would not be able to wear them.The cans do flip and the headphones fold for easier travel and storage.They came with no accessories.The sound on these headphones are pretty good. I tested them while editing a few clips, while listening to multiple genres of music, an audiobook, and while gaming. Most of my testing was holding the can to my hear, thanks to the flip, because they gave me a headache to wear for any period of time. The bass is more elevated in these, resulting in a more enjoyable listening experience than some of the other monitoring headphones people recommend, and while I think the bass might sound slightly nicer than the Sony MDR-7506, the rest of the sound, in particular recorded voice, is not as clear.If you have a business where you're not overly worried about people's comfort and you just want a cheaper pair of monitoring headphones that won't be destroyed when various people use and abuse them, then these are probably a great buy at around $100. If you don't want your own head to be crushed and you want better quality sound, I would pick up the Sony MDR-7506 at the same price (although I got mine for $20 cheaper because they were on sale).","Reviewed in the United States January 21, 2023",AEJ36DRZ223M2KTUAJYOWYD6BRTQ,True,17,Style: New ModelPattern: Headphone

R2046JN5T2VYYQ,B00IT0IHOY,5.0 out of 5 stars Awesome!,Sam Bray,5,"I love love love these headphones! I bought them because I dabble in making music and wanted a reasonably priced pair of studio monitor phones. But I also listen to a ton of music and it's almost all with these. They sound great! I can't stand hyped headphones and these fit the bill while still being excellent for listening. For comparison I also have a pair of Sony MDR-V6's and while they are probably good monitor headphones they don't sound nearly as good as the Sennheisers for regular listening.The 64 ohm impedance is also great - it's enough to block low-level noise in your device's output but not so much that they can't be powered by a normal phone or laptop (or one of those usbc-3.5mm adapters which is what I'm using now).The ambient sound attenuation is no joke either. They aren't as good as my 34db atten shooting earmuffs or real noise cancelling but you should be able to hear your music without completely blasting it in all but the noisiest environments. Be warned that you may fail to hear your loved ones even if listening to music at a pretty low volume!For longevity, my first pair of these lasted over five years of heavy use before one of the speakers stopped working. If I knew what I was doing I probably could have fixed them but I don't so I bought another pair. That one is still going strong; all I've had to do is replace the earpads which started to flake after 4 or 5 years.Overall I highly recommend these headphones for music lovers and amateur music-makers. I'm sure there are better headphones out there but they will almost certainly run you a lot more than these and unless you are extremely particular about your sonics they probably won't seem that much better.","Reviewed in the United States November 25, 2023",AF344LAHHRCNP74QOG6EBGUJ6H4A,True,3,Style: New ModelPattern: Headphone

RZ1V6NCBV9E9P,B00IT0IHOY,4.0 out of 5 stars Good set,MMADD,4,"SOUND QUALITY: 4/5 Crisp toneI was reading reviews of sound leakage and folks saying that there isn't any. Well I tested this out for myself and there is sound leakage. I listen to a lot of Heavy Metal and maybe since this is loud music, it's different. I was playing at max volume to test. I found that they have significantly less sound leakage than my other cheap headphones made by Sony and especially when played at mid range volume. Anyway, the sound quality of these is good so far. There is toned treble with punchy bass. Not a huge bit of bottom end though. Things seem to be well rounded and balanced. I notice I can hear instrument clarity a lot better with these headphones. Each instrument is defined and well heard if mixed correctly. I have read things about the sound maturing after a while or what some people like to call ""burning in"" and I haven't experienced this yet because my set is fairly new. I only expect a small change after a hundred hours or so and most of that will probably be my ears getting used to the sound of these head phones. I can say that these headphones produce a good professional sound for the money and the quality of tone is crisp. The noise cancelling aspect I'd say is good only when you have something playing. I could clap my hands in front of my face and couldn't hear it. When the music was off, I could hear things plane as day.DURABILITY: 5/5These headphones seem to be very sturdy, though I haven't dropped them or say on them yet, I can tell they will stand up to the test of time. I've read reviews of a metal band inside the headphones. I can believe that since these headphones have some weight to them. The cord is a long spiral cord (not super heavy as I thought it'd be) very well built and the headphone jack seems to be very robust as well. The adapter is gold plated for better connection. The head phones themselves swivel around 180 degrees and these headphones do collapse for better storage. I can't complain in the construction factor of these head phones. Very good quality there.COMFORT: 3.8/5These headphones are a bit bulky. This is a good and bad thing. They are kind of heavy and fit snug on my head and ears. They fit entirely over my ears. I have medium/large ears and there isn't much more room to work with which is fine for me but maybe not with someone with larger ears. The padding at the top of the set is good so the plastic doesn't get uncomfortable after hours of use. I had these on for about 3-4 hours and I got a little tired of wearing them probably because I'm not used to them quite yet. It's my first day with them. The cord stays out of the way unlike other headphones with the cords coming down on both sides. That gets utterly annoying when they always get snagged on something. One more thing to note is when you take them off to rest on your neck, this is a bit like wearing a neck brace and it's very uncomfortable. So if you are one of those people like me who when doing something just pop headphones off and rest them around the neck, it's a bit hard to do that and it may take me a while to get used to this aspect. But this is what happens when you buy higher grade headphones.Style: 3/5These headphones are again, bulky. There is a clearance on both sides about an inch and a half above the headphones from the band to your head. I find this a little wonky looking and not so sleek. I really could care less about what I look like with them on but some others may take this into account.OVERALL: 4/5Good headphones for the money. I bought mine used for 45 and they came like new. For 100 bucks I can say that yes these headphones are probably worth that. They are good sounding, and they block out mostly all noise from outside once you have something playing.","Reviewed in the United States January 8, 2016",AFR2B5LEYILS7LCCDJQSP3R73QRQ,True,2,Style: Old ModelPattern: Headphone

R283IHV76QXI4F,B00IT0IHOY,5.0 out of 5 stars Excellent Sound Quality and Top-Notch Sound Isolation,Sean,5,"I needed a pair of headphones with strong passive noise isolation. I was originally going to get this over a year ago, and now I finally did. I'm glad to say that I don't regret buying them, because they sound so good and yet deliver sound isolation that comes close to a pair of ear defenders.I've seen mixed reviews about the 280 Pro's sound quality for personal use, but the sound seems to work out well for me. Despite wearing glasses, the subbass doesn't seem to roll off at all, which helps up for the slightly underemphasized midbass. Pretty much anything that doesn't rely heavily on midbass is going to sound amazing on these headphones. Music that is midbass heavy will sound a bit dull without using EQ. The mids sound fantastic, and so does the treble. The treble is slightly underemphasized from 2k to 8k, which helps reduce harshness, but doesn't sacrifice any clarity at all. Soundstage is very good for a closed-back headphones, and imaging is spectacular to say the least.Comfort-wise, I find them very comfortable to use for hours at a time. I feared they might be a little too clampy at first, but that doesn't seem to be an issue for me.Sound isolation is second to none among the headphones I have. It even outperforms the Koss Pro4S in sound isolation. Both measure similarly in sound isolation from InnerFidelity's measurements, but from personal experience, the Sennheiser HD 280 Pro beats the Koss Pro4S quite a bit in sound isolation. These come so close to ear defenders in sound isolation that it isn't funny. The outstanding sound isolation ensures that you can listen to your music while cutting down external noise to a dull roar if not blocked out entirely. Sound leakage is almost nonexistent.The coiled cable is permanently attached, which isn't too much of a deal for what I use them for, but it certainly is going to make it awkward to use while taking walks or going out in public. I still have my Koss Pro4S, which I use for those purposes anyway, so the Sennheisers stay at home.Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with the Sennheiser HD 280 Pro. Sure, if the midbass was at the same level as the subbass, it would make these headphones more fun to listen to, but I'm not going to complain given their outstanding imaging, soundstage, and clarity and lack of major peaks and dips in frequency. 9/10 for sound quality, 10/10 for sound isolation, imaging, clarity and soundstage (by closed-back standards).","Reviewed in the United States June 16, 2022",AHKWIPEURFP4ZVGJBGLTTTJ77LHQ,True,17,Style: New ModelPattern: Headphone
R2J1XUL0JO5V98,B00IT0IHOY,"5.0 out of 5 stars Brilliant sound quality, and tough.",seraphimblade,5,"I got these after becoming frustrated with the ""consumer"" noise-cancelling headphones, and listening to a professional pair while helping a friend tune DJ equipment. After dealing with cord breaks (had to hold that pair dead still or you'd get cutting out and fuzz), cracking headbands, and loss of sound quality over time, I'd had more than enough. I was also sick of the slight hiss you get with active noise-cancelling, and the fact it only slightly mutes outside noise.The difference with these is hard to imagine, until the first time you hear them. They are, as has been previously stated, a bit toward the ""bright""/treble end, but I don't find that pronounced or distracting. I can hear nuances in songs that I've been listening to for years and never noticed before-the slight tremble of guitar or piano strings after the hit, the crash and reverb of drums, slight tone shifts in vocals. These are designed as ""monitoring"" headphones, and the fidelity definitely comes through there.These do produce a lot of sound. Be forewarned that if you're used to listening to standard headphones on any device, ratchet the volume down several notches before you put these on. They don't distort at high volume (at least not as high as I could stand it to test), but they could get painful.The nice part is, though-you won't even want or need to listen to these at high volume! Even at a moderate volume, the nuances in the music come through crisp and clear, and the passive noise exclusion design works. At a reasonable volume, you'll shut out all but the loudest noises. I tried them right next to a running sink with some music on, and couldn't even hear the water running. I've also used them in several real situations, such as at work and on the train with people talking right next to me-not one sound. Of course, if you normally use headphones outside (especially near traffic), do be aware that these will shut out the sound of an approaching car very well too.For design quality, I think the part I like best is the cord. It's not your standard hair-thick headphone cord-it's a heavy, thick coiled cord like an old-style telephone handset cord. Having had cords break or develop twitches when touched or moved wrong in previous pairs of headphones, I love this-if you manage to break this one, you're REALLY abusing it. And even in that event, it's user-replaceable. This also leaves a lot of slack in the cord to stretch, if necessary. The top headband is plastic and well-padded, which also is very comfortable. The pleather cuffs on the headphone are soft and comfortable, and while I suspect they may wear out at some point, they are also user-replaceable. These are clearly designed to keep going for years, and I suspect they'll well outlast the 2 year manufacturer's warranty.Caveats: First, they're large, even folded up. If you're looking for something to keep in your pocket, these are not what you want. They also don't come with a bag, but I find they fit well in a larger Crown Royal bag, which I've normally used for my headphones. They are, as mentioned before, a bit toward the treble end. I still find them to have a good bass response even in heavy-bass music, but if you're looking for the ""bass boost"" style, these also might disappoint you. I've read some reviews stating that they had issues fitting on larger heads, but I can't see that-mine's pretty good sized and there's still plenty of slack in the headband to loosen them up further.Even at the $150 regular price, these would be well worth it. At their current price (under $100), I can't imagine you'd get any better for the money. If you're not used to higher-grade headphones, they'll blow you away.","Reviewed in the United States December 27, 2011",AEERYIV6QL5F22FWA562RVBY3F4Q,True,3,Style: Old ModelPattern: Headphone
R2YNP2P3BINS83,B00IT0IHOY,5.0 out of 5 stars Metal Detectors Super Find,night watcher,5,"If you are a metal detecting enthusiast you may not find a better pair of headphones than these. If your not a hunter, we won't hold that against you, buy them anyway cause you will love them.I have been hunting for almost 2 months and went through two pairs of Fisher headphones, one without the coiled cord -which just stopped working in the middle of use and one with the coiled cord -which the wires came out of the jack. I then bough a pair of Bounty Hunters and found they were the EXACT same headphone as the coiled Fisher ones and the wires pulled out of jack the same way. Besides the fact that these all broke, they all were the most extremely uncomfortable things to wear! They crushed my ears and I could only wear them for a short time. Then I bought a pair of Garrets, they were more comfortable then the Fisher or Bounty Hunter, but the right ear phone stopped working only after a week of using them.I then borrowed a pair from a friend till I bought my E-trac, which unfortunately comes with a pair of Minelab headphones. These were comfortable, sounded good, but would not stay on my head unless I wore a hat under them because there is no tension in the arch. I was at the limit of my sanity to find a pair of coiled headphones that fit well, produced good sound, allowed some ambient sound through, and lasted more than a few weeks.Believe me when I say the Sennheiser HD-280 PRO headphones exceed all my expectations. Comfort is unparalleled! I can wear these all day long without any discomfort or fatigue. The ear pieces fit perfectly around my ears and the tension is perfect keeping them securely where they belong even during the ""I found another silver"" dance and you don't get that feeling of your head being squeezed in a vice after wearing them. The cord is fairly long with a soft coil that holds taunt but stretches easily when you need it. I'm tall, 6' 2"", and I find that the extra cord is a great benefit because I can put my detector down and stand up and even take a few steps away without the headphones being pulled off my head. Also note the jack is 3.5 but comes with a 6.35 adapter that threads onto the 3.5 essentially locking it in place. The sound is amazing! If your a serious hunter you know how important clean and crisp sound is when identifying buried treasure or trash. The low tones are great for listening for those Buffaloes, mid-tones are super clean and you never heard the sound of silver ring so clear and vibrant as with the HD-280 PROs. Being able to hear background sounds is just as important as hearing your detector, and these do a good job of that. Did I mention that they also fold up for easy storage in a backpack and are super light weight? Now I've only used these for a few days, but felt compelled to author this product review for the benefit of metal detecting hobbyists. These are super-awesome! Cash in some of those clad-coin caches and upgrade to the HD-280 PRO and hunt in comfort!Here is an update. I recently purchased a Minelab ctx 3030 and was truly happy to learn that these awesome headphones work perfectly with my new detector! And I firmly believe every word that I wrote about these headphones after hundreds of hours of use in all kinds of weather conditions and locations including the beach. Through the scorching summer sun and now the brittle chill of winter these headphones are rock solid awesome!","Reviewed in the United States April 26, 2012",AFD5Y5BRK6WSITUMZP7RE3KS5XRA,True,0,Style: Old ModelPattern: Headphone

R36HSIOEK22J0D,B00IT0IHOY,4.0 out of 5 stars Sennheiser HD-280 Pro headphones -- Highly recommended,flshope,4,"I purchased these headphones for use with a high-fidelity stereo system. In terms of cost and elaborateness, I would describe my system as mid-fi, not high end. I listen mostly to CDs, classical music, some new age stuff, and occasionally a movie on DVD. I am in my 60s; so my idea of high fidelity is not even remotely satisfied by a computer with little plastic speakers and a 5-watt amplifier. My system is composed of ""separates"": the pre-amp and power amp are separate boxes. So I have considerable interest in sound quality.I bought the HD-280s so I can listen at night when I don't want to bother other members of my family. I did spend a little time reading reviews of headphones and settled on the HD-280s after reading a good review in PC Magazine. I did not do much comparison listening to other phones. I paid about $100 after checking several sources and finding little price variation. In my search for a purchase, I encountered vaguely similar phones ranging in price from around $50 to $1000 with a lot of options in the range $300-$400. I could not find any local stores where I could listen to these phones in advance of purchase, so I bought them sight-unseen and sound-unheard from Amazon, always a reliable source. The PC Magazine review can be found at:[...]The HD-280s are over-the-ear type -- that is, the ear cups fit entirely over and around the ears and are supported by cup pressure on the skull and not the ears themselves. Personally, I find this design more comfortable for long term use, i.e., hours. This design also confines the sound to the inner phone region so as not to bother other people nearby. The earphones swivel a lot of ways to allow compact storage and flat storage. These are not wireless: they include a 9-ft spiral cord. The connector is the 3.5 mm stereo jack, but a 1/4-in. adaptor is also included. The HD-280s do not include active noise cancellation or on-board volume control.I would judge the sound quality of the phones as very good. I think the phone designers perhaps intended that the primary application is studio monitoring of performances and recordings. As such, their accuracy might be considered somewhat clinical; that is, they very accurately reproduce their electrical input, including defects and aberrations in the source material without any sort of ""smoothing"". I understand that some phones by design intentionally smooth over aberrations and perhaps sound better to some people. I decided that I wanted the high definition, to hear the good as well as the bad. I wanted to compare sound quality between my speakers (Klipsch Fortes) and the phones, where the phones are presumably the most accurate reproduction (Klipsch might disagree -- they do make very good speakers). The headphones, at least, eliminate room interactions which (ask any audiophile) can make a big difference in what you hear.To judge the phones relative to my speakers, I listened to favorite recordings that I consider both musically and sonically impressive. For classical, I listened to several of Mozart's symphonies from the complete symphony cycle by Hogwood and the Academy of Ancient Music on L'Oisseau-Lyre (452 496-2). For New Age, I listened to Enya's Watermark and Vangelis's Heaven and Hell and Chariots of Fire. I could hear considerably more detail on all recordings with the phones, but the Mozart and Vangelis sounded better on the phones while the Enya was better on the speakers. To my surprise, I heard a sort of raspiness on the Enya with the phones that was not apparent on the speakers. While Enya's music is splendid, I'm not sure the recording quality is as good as the Vangelis. Well, so be it: that's one of the reasons I bought the phones.Generally speaking, I would highly recommend the Sennheiser HD-280 Pro headphones.","Reviewed in the United States May 5, 2013",AHUWABCKGWEGF7EEAMTAPHTLKTYQ,True,2,Style: Old ModelPattern: Headphone
R2RSM641VF97KW,B00IT0IHOY,5.0 out of 5 stars Sennheiser has finally made a really good Closed-Back headphone for less than $100!!!,BUTCHO,5,"The Sennheiser HD 280 Pro ""New Model"" Assembled in the USA is a game-changer for me. Over the years I have tried several Senn Closed-Back headphones only to wonder how they could make some of the best Open Back Headphones and some of the worst Closed headphones. I'll back up a bit. My first pair of headphones was a pair of Koss Pro 4AA's. I had just gotten out of the Army and it was 1971. I loved them. I still have a pair of Koss Porta Pros to this day. My current headphone collection includes the Sennheiser HD 580 Jubilee, HD 650, and the New Model 280 HD Pro. I also have a pair each of the Fostex T50RP MK3; the Sony MDR V900HD and the Sony MDR 7506, The original Audio Technica ATH M30 and the ATH M40fs, as well as a vintage pair of JVC HA-D990's that are not for sale. None of these headphones are.While none of the above info proves anything where my headphone expertise is concerned, it does prove I have good taste where headphones are concerned. So here's the thing. With the New Model HD280Pro Sennheiser has shown the World that it can make a very competitive Closed-Back headphone at a price almost anyone can afford. In addition to the New Model Senn 280 I also recently bought a pair of Audio Technica ATH M40x headphones. In my opinion, they are not even close to being as well built as my Old pair of Audio Technica ATH M30s. In direct comparison the Old M30s make the relatively New ATH M40X cans seem like a toy to me. Nor did they have near the sonic relationship with either my Solid State Emotiva A-100 BASX Amp or my Little Dot MK II tube amp. At about the same price the New M40x was not an improvement over my Old M40fs cans. In my opinion the M40x is a joke compared to my M40fs cans. About the same price, but not even close in every other respect. The M40x is a throwaway can, the M40fs is a keeper. The New Model Sennheiser HD280 Pro is a keeper as well. Very Neutral can. Lows, Mids, and Highs are ready to reveal what has been recorded. If you don't like their sound it is probably your Sound Souce that is at fault. Some Bands are really not very good. Some Recording Engineers are not very good either. Some Bands and some Recording Engineers are great. The New Model HD280Pro will reveal which it is. Become an Audiophile. If Zen is selling water by a river, then being an audiophile is learning to know the difference between dogs barking and a host of singing angels Don't get me wrong. Sometimes barking at the moon is just what the good Doctor ordered. But nothing compares to the singing of angels. I think I will shut up for now and try out my New Model Sennheiser HD280s on two of my favorite angels. George Jones, and Patsy Cline. It doesn't get any better than that.

They are comfortable and sturdy. My last pair were 3 years old when I accidentally left them on a bus during my commute. The wiring was all still perfect. The only sign of wear was the mid cushion on top of my head which was just starting to wear out. Keep in mind, these were used for about 5 hours daily.

R20IK696K31CR7,B00IT0IHOY,4.0 out of 5 stars Best headphones I've used for its price range!,Dillon W,4,"The new HD280PRO from Sennheiser has been a stellar addition to my collection. I was looking for a set of reference headphones for sound accuracy at a reasonable price and these fit the bill almost perfectly. They perform at a level that I would expect from a set closer to the 200 dollar price point. Overall build is quite solid and it is great to know that if anything would fail on it that Sennheiser sells parts for their headphones.I have had mine for 4 months and HEAR is my breakdown: (heh see what I did there... sorry)Pros:-Sound quality blows away most headphones in this price range.-Build quality is rock solid with added benefit of being able to be taken apart and replace parts in the worst case scenario.-Sound Isolation is quite fantastic for not being noise cancelling. You could seriously use these as earmuffs to block out sound even without any audio playing.-Balanced Sound, which is exactly what you expect for reference headphones. I love that these are able to produce crisp highs, clean mids, and healthy bass. You aren't going to experience muddy tones in your lows, and the highs are not breaking up. Keeps a focus on detail and does not disappoint.-Coiled wire makes is less cumbersome when managing the cable if on the go or in a shared office space.-Comes with a 3.5mm jack that you can thread on the included 1/4 inch connector.-Designed in Germany and built in the USA!Cons:-Comfort. This very well could be a personal issue based on head shape, but I find that these like to squeeze your head with the grip strength of a professional arm wrestler on steroids. I find myself struggling to keep these on my head for longer than an hour at a time, and it is strictly due to the strength of clamping pressure they have. Everything else is comfortable about them, but when you feel like there is a black hole between your ears pulling these ear cups in on you it is something worth noting...-Warm. While this may be a positive if you are in a heavily air-conditioned room or perhaps out about in the cold, then you will probably start to notice that these bad boys can create their own green house gas effect on the sides of your head. Hasn't really been much of an issue for me.-Limited Sound-stage. Kind of expected from a reference closed back set with great sound isolation.Overall these cans are great. I know I went a little ham on the description of their ability to compress your skull (potentially enough to even turn Arnold's head from the hit show ""Hey Arnold!"" back into a normal shape), but that is due to the lack of other complaints. This even could potentially be mitigated by storing these on a headphone stand that keeps them stretched, or even trying some different ear pads. This is easily outweighed by their performance in every other category.If I had to purchase another closed-back headphone for even $150 or less then I would save that extra $50 dollars for an investment elsewhere and buy these again. If I notice any changes in the future I will be sure to update.","Reviewed in the United States May 5, 2019",AGLODUHOIYTHA7X7ZLMBDPTMEKAQ,True,9,Style: New ModelPattern: Headphone

When I first got these, they were just OK, the clarity was great and the high end reproduction was very clear, but the low end didn't seem to come through with much 'oomph'. After reading some audio forums it seemed the consensus was that it actually takes around 500 hrs of play time on these for them to really start to shine. I decided to run pink noise into them with the volume at a moderate level for a few nights and I've probably got maybe 50-60 hrs of listening time on them on top of that and I can say that they are starting to sound much richer. The bass is starting sound much fuller and the highs and mids are still crystal clear.One of the best things about this set is the noise isolation. I work in an office area and the lady next to me has no sense of self awareness, but she's super nice so I just bite my tongue. I needed some headphones to drown out her singing along with her music when she has her headphones on, and to drown out her music when she decides to take them off and crank them up to try and use them as loudspeakers. These do the job. I also want to keep the music in so others don't have to listen to my music with me. These do the job. I originally got a pair of V-MODA LP2's, and they sounded great, but leaked sound like a sieve. I returned them and went with these and there is a world of difference in that regard. I expect they will be fantastic on an airplane as well.One thing I have noticed is that in order to get the best bass response you need to keep them sealed against your head. When I wear my glasses with them it breaks that seal slightly and the there is a noticeable difference in the bass response. I am planning on building a headphone amplifier with a variable bass boost to try to remedy that (yes, I know they are commercially available but I am cheap and an electrical engineer). I also am not a huge fan of the hard mounted coiled cord, but I am also going to chop that off and install an inline 3.5mm jack, which should also allow me to buy a cable with iPhone controls on it. Anyways, so far I am very happy with these headphones.UPDATE: I was able to chop off the bulky coiled cord and install a 3.5mm jack to allow me to plug in a smaller audio cord, making it a little more comfortable to listen to. I purchased the following cable and now I have iPhone controls with these headphones:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01149EHSQ?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00If you decide to try this, just be aware that the conductors inside the insulation are magnet wire, meaning they have a thin coating on them so they are difficult to solder to. You can get rid of it by tinning the wire, but it does make it a little difficult to work with.","Reviewed in the United States November 18, 2015",AFL37HDYGRU6AN7VTPGO5QGN2R2A,True,69,Style: Old ModelPattern: Headphone

While the price says they are the best, what I am hearing says otherwise."" So I emailed them, asking for frequency responses & was told they don't publish them as they are not that important! Hmmm... while I agree that what you hear IS more important than numbers, I still want the numbers! Then I listened to a set of Senheisers. Night & day difference! Went on line to Amazon.com (because I trust them) & ordered a set of HD 280 Pro's. What you hook them up to & the quality of the recording you are listening to DOES MATTER! After all, they ""reproduce sound"", they DO NOT ""Generate sound""! They will sound better wired to a quality home audio system playing vinyl (or yes... even a CD!) than when connected to an iPOD playing a MP3! (For many reasons, which are not the topic of this review!) The headroom from this set of cans is OUTSTANDING! The low-end frequencies are quality... not muddy and not distorted. Mids for voice and most instruments are clean & clear and the highs are very crisp and clean... not painful as with some cans. You can pick out vocals on Pink Floyd mixes that you have neaver heard before! And Gilmore's leads... WOW! THD is, for all intents and purposes, non-existant! Seperation is as good as the recording will allow. Noise is as quiet as is your system... and if there is any on your system, you will hear it! This set of cans is not made for noise-reduction (noise-cancelling), but as they are ""closed cans"", they do a good job. I could only rate them as 3 stars for longevity, simply because I have only had them a short time. However I will say, they seem ""quality"" in materials. Are they the best headphones for my use? HELL NO, because I can't afford $1,000.00 to $1,500.00 for ""the best""! But if I could, they would be marked ""Sennheiser"", and I would buy them through Amazon.com! For what I CAN afford to pay, I LOVE THEM!","Reviewed in the United States January 11, 2011",AGK7HT3O7YMB2DHZJUPORZGLS5MA,True,3,Style: Old ModelPattern: Headphone
R1FBOQT9HQR2QE,B00IT0IHOY,4.0 out of 5 stars Best purchase I've made,XGibran,4,"****UPDATE SEPTEMBER 13 2016****I had to come back to say that these headphones still sound amazing, maybe better than ever. I have had no sound issues despite heavy use, though I did stop using them much during the last year (I moved and forgot all about them in an unpacked bag). The one thing is that the leathery parts have deteriorated badly and they look much more beat up than they should, but after all this time of use in a tropical country I'm okay with having to replace them.********I am absolutely in love with these headphones. The sound is great and clear, when you crank up the volume you get louder music with no distortion, though the bass is a bit lacking (they are monitors, after all). I have tested them with everything, from Classical to Death Metal and I love the performance. I get chills with all the little things I can appreciate thanks to them (even the little snap when the singer's mouth opens... Lovely)I travel 4 hours a day several times a week with really noisy coworkers that, quite frankly have a taste for lame music and with earbuds we waged an eternal war with sheer volume (a war I was bound to lose because of the damage I was doing to my ears). When I put these babies on the first time I got misty-eyed... I could listen to music at a moderate level and their voices... Simply vanished! The isolation works incredibly well. I can only listen to some faint comments when the music goes low or between songs, but even then the noise reduction is considerable.I also have used them for gaming and the detail is amazing! Specially on FPS games you feel you're really inside the game. Pair these up with a game like Mirror's Edge or Call of Duty and you will get some serious thrills.My main concerns with these headphones were size and comfort. Due to reports that they were too small I honestly wouldn't have bought them if I didn't have a friend who was willing to buy them from me if I changed my mind. I have a big head (Baseball caps fit on the last two holes) and I was very pleased with the fit I got. I don't even use them at max and they sit atop my big head with comfort. Like I said, I use them for hours with no problems, though I should mention that in hot weather the leather-like material gets rather hot.I feel the padding may not be too durable, the ""leather"" covering feels like it could be easily pierced and a pouch would have been very, very nice to have.I should note I spent almost a week reading reviews, talking to friends who own several pairs on this scale before I made my choice. I learned a lot and the time spent paid off.Overall, the Senns have been great for the month I have had them. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to my friends.","Reviewed in the United States October 3, 2011",AEJQD4N5CRQXRHAAAD4G2DB7C6LQ,True,1,Style: Old ModelPattern: Headphone
R2OEQUJ7O1V0LE,B00IT0IHOY,5.0 out of 5 stars Best passive sound insulation,Aristocles,5,"Thanks to covid, I've recently had a weekly radio show go from professional studio in town to streaming from my basement and/or office. I've been trying to assemble something of an in home studio for me and my father (the hosts). He's got hearing aids and so when he turns up the volume on his set, you can hear his sound leak into his mic. So I wanted to replace some crazy-leaky old Sony Professional MDRs (7506?) that a studio engineer had given my dad years ago (the earpods were holding on by a thread). Because we were ""uninvited"" from the studio at the last minute, I went to Best Buy and threw down for the fairly expensive $300 Sony MDR-1A M2s--there were limited options, and I didn't want to mess around with something low-quality. While I like the built-in mic of those headphones (not so much for radio, but they'll substitute for your iPhone headphones or Xbox One rig, for example, or they're great for Zoom calls if you don't want to summon an entire shock-mounted, reflection filter, boom arm mic for a virtual happy hour with friends), they're kind of...underwhelming. And the ear holes (they're circumaural) are a little small, and they never fit my dad right--they still leaked. So when it came to buy a second pair, I did a lot of research and got some Audio-technica ATH MX40s. They were more reasonably priced, had flatter sound (which for spoken radio is useful), and supposedly had good sound insulation. They work great for me, but again, my dad somehow had a pretty big sound leak. I did some more research and stumbled on these Sennheisers. A) the sound they put out sounded remarkably better for my dad and B) they insulate like a tomb. We have a winner! Not a detachable cord, but for the price you could have three of these for one Sony MDR-1A M2. Cord is a little bulky since it's got the pigtail extendable section, but you may like that (the Sony cord is fairly short--again think: phone in pocket--the audio-technica's is absurdly long--think: wandering around a relatively large studio without having to stretch bizarrely). All this is by way of saying, I've tried some really great units across the spectrum, and I like these $100 Sennheisers better than the $300 Sonys and the $80 Audio-technica when it comes to passive sound insulation with a usefully larger ear-hole and remarkably better (and flatter) sound for spoken voice.","Reviewed in the United States September 30, 2020",AFFNUPZ6NWYOO7L4KIJPTWLCIKVQ,True,1,Style: New ModelPattern: Headphone

R1OIUHHPVSVEEX,B00IT0IHOY,"3.0 out of 5 stars Don't be misguided by my raiting, let me explain!",Brennan,3,"First off I want to address why this item received a 3/5 score. While the score itself isn't terrible, there is a reason for docking the headphone 2 stars. When I originally got this item it was essentially unwearable. What I mean by this is that it was too tight/uncomfortable for me to wear for longer than 20 minutes or so. After stretching it nightly on about a 10 inch or so box (couldn't find a ruler) they began to stretch nicely. However, even after nights of doing this it still took me at least a week of wearing it for approx 8+ hours daily. I use the computer heavily each day so I need something that is comfortable for looong hours, not just a few. Eventually after at least a weak of constant use and nightly stretching (and some pain D:) the headphones are actually very nice. I could even see myself upping the rating if I become very attached to these. After the first few days of getting these I was disappointed, they were uncomfortable, etc. Now a days they are actually pretty comfortable and if I could have gotten them in their current state I would have essentially no cons.Also a side note to the headphones being tight. It wasn't just that they were tight, but also that it bothered my ears. My ears are not large but I guess they protruded too much? Anyways it bothered them a bit but eventually I either got used to it or the headphones just became broken in. For further detail I am a 6' skinny male with an oval head. Not sure if that could possibly help but it doesn't hurt, my head isn't small but I don't consider it to be massive or anything.GAMING - For gaming these sound AMAZING. Or at least that's my opinion. My old headset was a cheap $15 thing so this is obviously an upgrade. But games sound really good. I have diagnosed ADD (that's right not only do I say it but I have meds for it :P) and it can be hard for me to stay focused even in games. However, the amount of immersion I feel that these add is awesome! I haven't tested these heavily with any of my fps games as of yet so I can't get into super specifics for those that really count on noise in their games. I will add that I am not using a spiffy sound card so I do not have any sort of created surround sound, which I'm sure would help.YOUTUBE/VIDEOS/ETC - I don't think that's where these would shine. My reason being that a lot of videos on the web do not contain high end audio. Of course with the top youtubers you may notice it at high settings, etc. Basically the quality still has to be there in order for the headphones to pick it up.MOVIES - Haven't heavily tested this. I can say that I bet they are great. Some of the games I play with these have cinematics that I would easily believe to have at least the same quality of sound that you would find in a movie, and they sound SUPERB. Because of this I could see these pulling it off.MUSIC - Probably what most people are using these for anyways. After getting these headphones I have started going out of my way to find higher quality music along with hearing my current music before my audio program decided to down convert it. I never really realized that you have to go into your music player settings and make it so that the music itself isn't down converted so that is something I learned. As far as specifics and sound, as some have said these headphones are good all around but, for example, their bass is no super amazing. In addition I feel that the music shines a bit more when it is really loud, maybe it's me but I do feel that they begin to shine a little bit at louder levels. Now as mentioned I do not have a dedicated sound card, while I don't think it would be mandatory to have one I do feel it could help a bit. Ultimately the high quality your music is, the better it will sound.SOUND CANCELING - Originally I wanted an open air headphone but that didn't happen. These cancel sound out very well, if you are a very alert person you can still tell if people are trying to talk to you etc. If you are someone that can get really into things and ignore the world than these basically would cancel out everything. I consider myself very good at noticing the slightest sounds so if someone was to knock on my room door I generally hear it unless my sound is loud. These are not something that you could wear well carrying on a conversation though, it gets too hard to tell what someone is saying. They are closed ear and do a good job at reducing outside noise, etc.TL;DR - Great heaphones, for some like me they take a lot of time until they are comfortable for long hours. For anything cinematic or epic, these sound FANTASTIC. For everything else, they are great but not to the level where I'm about to explode of awesome. Get what is good for you and your needs. Try these on prior to buying if you can.","Reviewed in the United States January 29, 2012",AFEGUA25JM2ZGMIA5EOTUBC3VOZA,True,3,Style: Old ModelPattern: Headphone

Cable finally wore out. I use my headphones for audio when working, gaming, and general purpose non-professional use. Hours a day, at home, with kids and a dog.I thought I'd try the Sennheisers as I don't love how ""floppy"" the Sony MDR's are - very difficult to manage one-handed while gaming, tend to fold up too easily.The Sennheisers are pretty comfortable, though perhaps a bit too tight (I'm 6' but with a normal-for-that-size head) even well adjusted. Not sure how comfortable they'd be after 4 hours of Starfield.But what kills the product is that the audio cable from the left ear cup transmits the SLIGHTEST touch/movement directly into my left ear. Cable brushes against collar? SHSHSHSHSHRRR Arm brushes anywhere along the cable? SSSSSHSHSHI think part of the issue is the cable is a little rough to the touch, but the bigger issue is that there's no baffle between the cable and its attachment point on the ear cup. Every slight vibration is directly transmitted. I'm no audio prima-donna, but listening to anything other than hard rock at high volume, I heard it every time I moved my arm. VERY distracting. I compared my old pair and the new one side-by-side to make sure it wasn't just ""new = bad"". It's not.

These are WAY better and give a crystal clear picture of what your mix actually sounds like. Beforehand, with the AKG, I had to bump up the bass and mids A LOT, to the point where it sounded bad on the headset in order to get a desirable sound in real world use. That is to say they did not give a good idea of what the mix actually sounded like, which is what you want in studio monitors. Enter these Sennheisers. Once I got these I tried to make a quick mix, knowing I wasn't familiar with how they reproduced sound yet, so I just mixed such that it sounded good on the headset. I was blown away when I tested the mix in my car and on my media headphones and it sounded great. For those who haven't gotten the idea of what I'm trying to communicate yet, I'm saying what you hear on these is a GREAT representation of what you actually have in the real world.

R1MACJ8U1PVMY1,B00IT0IHOY,"4.0 out of 5 stars Wonderful, but a few problems you should consider.",Mike,4,"These are wonderful headphones. Powerful and bold. Very clear sound. Jumping into water in games like subnautica is booming and awesome. BUUUUT!!!!!1- SOUND ACCURACY- *good but not perfect*Deep bass on these- which you generally won't hear too often, is not very accurately reproduced. It will sound weak on these, yet on surround speaker or car speaker sets will be booming.There are other kinds of sounds that can have the opposite issue- sounding powerful on these but weak on your speaker sets.One of the big reasons I got these, was how many tech sites said they are about the most accurate set of cans. I haven't used enough sets to know for sure if this really is as good as it gets, I just know when writing music I have to use my speakers sometimes to make adjustments because the headphones are not quite accurate enough. They ARE accurate for what the sounds are, just not the volume levels of various instruments.2- HEAVY DUTY CORD BENDS THE PLUG!The CORD- It was praised in reviews but I disagree.It's a wound up spiral cord like a telephone has. This gives you great range if you stretch it out, but stretching out will likely just unplug it with all the added force tugging on the ends, so it isn't that useful a design anyways. The worst part is how much weight it has in a small area because it's a very long cord but wound up. And oddly enough it actually bent the plug that goes into the speakers after the cord was hanging down constantly- pulling on the plug. After a while my plug was in a c shape. After carefully bending it back to being straight it works okay, but now I have to make sure the cord is supported up so it doesn't happen again. If you buy this headset make sure you understand what I mean by this and plan for this. It's a soft metal they used here and it bends easy plus the cord is very heavy. The cord is annoying to hold on my lap as it inserts into the left can which is also another design flaw. Everyone on their computers will be plugging these into the RIGHT speaker, to your RIGHT, so the cord should insert into the RIGHT headset can- so the cord doesn't have to lay across your lap and get in the way.CONCLUSIONThose few problems are enough to get me to drop it to 4 stars. While I have only ever used a dozen or so headsets in my lifetime and these are the best- it just isn't comfy to wear these for long hard hours. They clamp down on your head pretty hard, and are not a relaxed fit like my old THOR-X which I end up preferring over these for the comfort alone. Still wonderful quality of sound, definitely better then my thor-x, but I generally only need these where I feel I really need that extra powerful sound.","Reviewed in the United States August 3, 2017",AFDK3AW2LVZZYU2OI7UBXZE2334A,True,0,Style: New ModelPattern: Headphone
R1T57ZUQXNZ012,B00IT0IHOY,"5.0 out of 5 stars Great for monitoring while tracking electric guitar: super comfortable, inspiring sound - just the right amount of isolation",Amazon Customer,5,"These are incredibly comfortable for long periods, and sound terrific. They seem sturdy too. I like the availability of original replacement parts (pads, cushions, cable, etc.). Headphones get lots of wear, so nice to be able to repair rather than replace.I got these for studio monitoring while tracking loud electric guitar. They are perfect for that. I need headphones that block out external sound form my amps, so I can hear the other tracks with which I am playing--without having to turn up the volume to ear-damaging levels. I was impressed by the specs that claim HD280 Pro has great sound isolation. Before the HD280 pros, I had been using an old drummer's trick--industrial earmuffs over ear buds. That worked great to block out the sound, but was uncomfortable for long sessions, and a bit cumbersome for on/off, and did not have the best sound.At first, I was not impressed with the sound isolation from the HD280 Pros. They do attenuate the high frequencies, but the low-mids and lows still get through. Honestly, the sound isolation claims for these headphones are way overblown, so hard hitting drummers or guitarists who play REALLY loud may wish to use specialized isolation headphones in favor of the HD280 Pro, to preserve their hearing. But for my use (loud, but not insane, guitar amps), I found I preferred the amount of leakage in the HD280 Pro over the nearly total isolation of muffs or drummer cans. I felt it kept me more connected to my playing than my previous setup, with which I relied solely on the in-ear monitor feed to hear my own guitar, since all outside sounds were blocked.I do have to turn the level up in the HD280 Pros, a bit louder than when using isolation muffs, to hear the background tracks over my cranked amp--but still not to levels that will damage my hearing. And the HD280 Pro's extreme comfort is a welcome improvement. More importantly, the SOUND quality of the HD280 is far superior to my prior setup. I was surprised to find the superior sound inspires my instrumental performance, and makes me feel and play better. These sounded great with virtually no break in. I imagine they will only improve over time.For really, really loud recording situations (requiring near total isolation), or mixing use (requiring a more neutral frequency response, and more natural soundstage than HD280Pro), I think other, specialized headphones would be a better bet.I highly recommend these to other guitarists for monitoring while recording---they have the perfect combination of features for it. They would also be terrific for vocalists or voice over performers, since the HD280Pros have sufficient isolation to keep the playback from leaking into sensitive vocal microphones. Also good for general listening, when you want to keep much (but not all) of the outside sounds out, or keep your music from being heard by others.","Reviewed in the United States September 7, 2017",AH7BTSFO77CNNKQFU7FBWTV5DI5A,True,31,Style: New ModelPattern: Headphone

Dude…the HD 280 Pro’s are FLAT, CLEAR, and the low end kicks like a sub! (somehow for headphones). When I swap between the HD 280’s and my rig it literally sounds damn near the same! The HD 280 Pro’s are the best choice for budget professional headphones!CONS:The HD 280 Pro’s squeeze your head too tight, fold in a stupid manner, don’t come with a case/bag, and they look dumb on your head. Lolz. But they are my recommendation for professional headphones!MY RIG:I have JBL LSR2325’s and a Genelec Sub which are phenomenal speakers especially with my treated room and they are tuned properly. My speakers do sound wider than the HD 280 Pro’s because they are spread out speakers, however I can hear some hard panned L/R nuances louder in the headphones than on my rig. So my rig isn’t perfect. Another thing I noticed is the HD 280 Pro’s seem to smooth out transient information a little. In Rita Ora’s Your Song, there are some sharp percussive clicks and synths. My rig really pronounces them whereas the HD 280 Pro’s seemed to have smoothed out the attack of the transients.AUDIO TECHNICA ATH M50:I already have Audio Technica ATH M50’s, which are way too bright! So much so it overshadows the low end. They seem to cut around 2kHz and boost drastically above 5kHz. but they are super crystal clear. Every nuance can be heard in a track. And they are the most comfortable headphones out of them all.SONY MDR 7506:The competing headphones with the HD 280 Pro’s are the Sony MDR 7506’s. In my A/B testing these actually lost a lot of high frequency information in different spots on the frequency spectrum. When A/B-ing them it was night and day noticeable that information was being lost between 1kHz and 20kHz. It wasn’t like a shelf was dampening the high end, but instead multiple sharp bell curves cutting out frequencies. The instruments were there and present, but Vocals sounded muffled, cymbals were no longer crisp, and there was no air to lift the track. The low end was meh.

R2O55TBU34B9HM,B00IT0IHOY,5.0 out of 5 stars Neutral + Balanced + Isolating + Detailed = A Sennheiser Classic.,Amazon Customer,5,"I've spent a few years in the audio industry, and these are a fantastic value for the casual listener. If you're into warm, open backed headphones, look elsewhere. If you want isolating, neutral, balanced headphones, you can't do better than these. The newest model is insanely comfortable. The clamping force is firm, but not bad.If I had to pick a single word to describe these headphones, I would use ""detailed."" Let me give you an example. I love listening to ""What a Fool Believes"" by the Doobie Brothers for its drum content. It is very articulate, but the drum mix is quiet enough that many sound systems (headphones, monitors, etc) that lack detail will have the drums overpowered by the vocals. These headphones do a great job keeping the neutral, balanced sound. The 1997 remastering of ""I Don't Believe in You"" by Talk Talk really shines through here - the instrumental breaks are crazy. It really feels like you're standing next to the guitar, the drums, the synth.Now, bass. This is a controversial topic for many. If you want ""BIG, BOOMY BASS,"" look elsewhere. Plugged straight into your amp, they will be very weak in the sub-100hz frequency range compared to other modern headphone. That's normal. These are professional monitoring headphones. Personally, for casual listening, I like to give a small bump of three to six dB in the 60-90 hz range. 65 Hz is where much of the ""punch"" from a kick drum comes from, and the headphones are able to handle it with no problem. ""Ribs"" by Lorde is a good track for pop music - it has a clean bass track, female vocals, and interesting soundstage panning (without being too crazy). On a bad system, the bass can be a bit ""boomy,"" so it's a good test. On these headphones, its not overpowering at all, and fits quiet well into the mix.At the end of the day, throw whatever you want at them. Want to slap a low-end shelf on your EQ and crank the bass? I wouldn't, but if you did, these headphones will accept the punishment. 10/10 performance.I would recommend this to students looking for some peace and quiet, anyone in the WFH crowd, and for people who are looking for an accurate pair of headphones.","Reviewed in the United States November 3, 2020",AGBS4XRU2RPACQ6NZDKB3PRGS66A,True,2,Style: New ModelPattern: Headphone

And the sound that you get out of them is absolutely unbelievable. I love music, and this has finally satisfied my craving to get quality sound from my phone. The cord seems to be incredibly durable.

R15JGN9OOQZXI3,B00IT0IHOY,5.0 out of 5 stars A musician's take,Ikeeptime,5,"Im a drummer. I use a high end electronic kit through headphones. In practicing at home my system channels hi resolution music through the phones and I am able to hear both music and drums while I play. Have been using a pair of Beats Mixr phones for about a year but they are on-ear and no noise cancellation. Hearing the taps and thuds on each trigger pad when playing, tho not at a very high volume, is not optimal. Bought the Sennheiser HD 280 Pro over ear phones and used them first time today. My goal is simply to hear no outside noise. Put on a recording of Jean Luc Ponte's album ""Cosmic Messenger"" and sat down to practice. Astounding! Not only were the outside strike noises unheard but the clarity of sound was very very good. Impressive is the spacial range of the music. What once was almost flat is now a true 4 D experience sonically. The nuances across the spectrum is just perfect. True reproduction as it was meant to be heard. No eardrum fatigue after an hour of louder than usual playing (got a bit carried away).

R3G22E1KAUYU38,B00IT0IHOY,5.0 out of 5 stars Snug Excellence,Aviator,5,"I bought these headphones over a year ago and use them almost everyday. I had read every review I could find because I knew how much I'd be using them and needed quality without breaking the bank. I couldn't be happier.As many reviews state they are snug, but comfortably so. I forget I'm wearing them, a lot. I'll notice I still have them on after I've listened to whatever it was. I'll be checking my emails having been done listening 20 minutes ago and notice I'm still wearing them. The padding is comfortable and when the sound is finished, outside noise is soo quiet I forget they're on my head.The sound quality - What more could you ask for??? Pristine. Well rounded. Well balanced. Full. You would have to be a real headphone snob to be anything but impressed with the sound! I am a recording musician with my own recording studio and can recognize good/bad sound quality. I listen to all kinds of music and they all sound great. These will pull sound out of songs you've heard a thousand times and never noticed before. Still, every time I watch a movie on my laptop and slip these headphones on it almost makes me laugh when the movie starts because the sound is truly amazing; it's like wrapping the movie around you and you are center stage. I'm not kidding. I've heard that high end headphones need a break-in period before the true richness of the sound quality comes out... mm, ok. I don't know about all that but these sounded great right out of the box and still sound amazing. The sound might have gotten better but it sure has not lessened. Still clean, crisp and powerful at all levels like the day I bought them with zero hint of sound degradation.Material Quality - I treat these headphones like they are important to me but I don't baby them either. I take care of them but use them constantly. They are sturdy. The plastic is not flimsy. I was a little worried at first with the pivot points from the headband to the cups as that seemed to be the weakest spot. Really, the only way you're going to break these is by doing something stupid. They are built very strong and ready for heavy use. The only thing that has happened is the lining on the padding of the cups are beginning to undo from the inner cup area where it connects to the plastic. It affects nothing and doesn't bother me; I use the heck out of these things and contribute it to wear and tear, not manufacturer design fault. Again, I use these almost every day and sometimes hours at a time. They show no signs of breaking at all (and I've probably put a normal three years of use on them).My bottom line... Best headphones for the money. If they somehow disappeared, I'd come right back here and buy them again.","Reviewed in the United States October 4, 2009",AE2Y2PPFBV5QOOXSOD6CHVGLOTDA,True,0,Style: Old ModelPattern: Headphone

R5B10H58ZDA3D,B00IT0IHOY,4.0 out of 5 stars Excellent for the price...,A. Johnson,4,"I have a pair of Shure E2c's (in-ear) that have great sound quality but aren't practical for extended use (uncomfortable and tend to fall out frequently) which lead me to my search for on-ear or over-ear phones. In my search I listened to Bose, Grado, Audiosone, Sony, and many more.I found the search to be very difficult because headphones are such a personal choice. Apart from the qualities of fit and finish it is almost impossible to glean valuable information about sound because everyone hears differently. I wouldn't ever purchase headphones without having the opportunity to hear them first.I listen to mostly electronic music (trance, techno, house, drum & bass, etc. with some rock/alternative and hip-hop thrown in for good measure) and I prefer a ""bright"" sound where higher frequencies are enhanced. I like a clean, but not overpowering, bass response. So, in terms of what kind of sound I appreciate, the Sennheiser HD-280 Pro's fit the bill almost perfectly. There seem to be several complaints about them not being loud enough. When I was trying out headphones I took my own iPod with my own music so I could get a true gauge and I didn't find any phones in the range of these that were significantly better or worse in terms of loudness. Also, your problem could be the source and and not the headphones. Another reason to always 'try before you buy' with headphones.In terms of the fit and finish, I find these phones to be adequate. They're not the best looking things ever but seem plenty sturdy and I like the fact that pieces can be replaced when they become worn. They are bulky but they're not heavy. As with anything, if you're not already used to it there will be an adjustment period. After a couple of days of wearing them for several hours they have softened and don't seem nearly as tight as they were out of the box. They're not as comfortable as the Bose phones I tried (QC2, QC3, and Triport) but the sound quality is superior and the price is lower.Pros:* Great sound for the price (however I wouldn't pay the retail price of $199 for them)* Much better for extended listening than my in-ear Shure E2c's* ""High-wear"" pieces can be replaced* Commendable sound isolation without impacting the sound (as active noise canceling phones will do)* Accurate sound reproduction* Only a single cord coming from the headphonesCons:* Bulky (but not necessarily heavy)* Not very stylish (if that matters to you)* Not for people who want a lot of bass","Reviewed in the United States March 1, 2007",AFRNQWB3RM5ENEM3X2QGIHC752OA,True,3,Style: Old ModelPattern: Headphone

R52GI6ZG2R5BA,B00IT0IHOY,5.0 out of 5 stars Solid headphones,Josh,5,"I was never an audiophile before I bought these headphones, and now that I own a pair, I'm still not an audiophile. But these things really grab me. Quite literally, actually. They feel great. After wearing these for a while, I put on my $30 pair of Koss headphones, and they felt like junk. They've been in the drawer ever since. But that's by far not the only thing to like about these.One of my least favorite things about basically all headphones is the cord, but as someone who also hates batteries, I find myself in a sticky situation. These headphones help alleviate the problem by providing something like seventeen miles of cord if you actually stretch it out. Okay, maybe it's more like a comfortable eight feet or so, in all seriousness. The point is, it's okay if you forget you're wearing them and slide away from your perfectly-good laptop or unfortunately-oriented workstation. You won't break anything. You can even stretch without breaking things or disconnecting them. It seems so obvious; you just don't realize how annoying it is to have exactly four feet of cable until you haven't had to deal with that.If I had to nitpick, though, I'd say that the cord is also usually the most vulnerable part of any pair of headphones. I bought a $30 pair once that had a replaceable cord; the cord itself was just a double-male audio jack. It looked easy to replace. These headphones don't offer that. They seem to be one piece, so if anything breaks, I think it's broken for keeps. All the same, I've had them for nearly a year, now, and unlike any of my other headphones, THESE HAVEN'T BROKEN. For what it's worth, that particular $30 pair died because whatever connects the two earpieces broke. Happened to not be replaceable.If you want my recommendation, get these. I'll never buy a different pair of headphones. You don't have to be able to hear the difference between 128kb/s audio and 320kb/s audio, or even know what that means, to appreciate these headphones. If you're being me, jumping from $20 pair to $30 pair to $20 pair wondering why anyone would pay so much for some headphones, it's because they feel right and are made well, and will outlast all the other ones you've bought combined. I'll go ahead and point out that one of the people who recommended these to me has owned his pair for seven years. Another has owned his for four, but his are worse for wear (I didn't know the padding around the top of the band came off until I saw his, which is beginning to, despite looking simple to zip back up... maybe he just hasn't noticed).","Reviewed in the United States January 6, 2015",AHFE3J7M4QQ7USCJUQTH7JJXYI7Q,True,1,Style: Old ModelPattern: Headphone
ROFS3HQXOJ37Y,B00IT0IHOY,5.0 out of 5 stars Great headphones that would be equally good in either the home or the studio...and at a nice price,John S,5,"I’m totally in shock...these are a steal at $99. I’ve owned both the 580 and 600 models and have learned to love Sennheiser products. Both of those headphones found new homes for one reason or another several years ago. I had a few years when other priorities took control. Systems come and systems go. The last few months have found me building a new one, and as an apartment dweller, a good pair of headphones is often a necessity. For several years, I limped along with an older pair of smaller Senn’s...HD25 SP, that I had bought for use with a portable DVD player. They got me by when things got thin. So time to upgrade. I looked at the reviews of several of the competitors...but gut feeling said stay with Sennheisers. Good choice. These might not quite reach the same level of sound quality as the 580 or 600 models, but the differences will hardly be missed. There’s still a nice level of detail without going over the top. They’re also fairly neutral sounding except for one small chunk of audio spectrum..the lowest octave or so of bass. There seems to be a small rise in response in that area. Not huge but noticeable...and I shouldn’t complain as it’s really not a problem. But no one should be complaining that they’re shy on bass... at least if they’re being well driven. Equipment being used includes a modded Sony NS999ES DVD player that’s SACD compatible, feeding a NAD C 315BEE amp. The amp has no dedicated headphone driver...runs right off the final transistors...so there’s plenty of drive for 64 ohm cans. May not quite have the quality of a nice outboard HP amp, but it works pretty well. This is the kind of upgrade that makes you sit down and start listening to everything all over again. TELARC movie music was awesome, Vangelis soundtrack to Alexander was incredible, Jethro Tull remastered Stand Up was excellent...( any vintage Tull fans really need that one...great sound for 50 year old recording).. Andy Timmons: That Was Then, This Is Now is incredible..some great rock music that’s very well recorded. Only negative experience was with Deutsche Grammophon: Von Karajan: R. Strauss...heavy brass section got a little over the top, but that’s not unheard of for some DG recordings. And this is all with them fresh out of the box...things should get better when they break in a bit. And there’s an HP amp in my future. These cans feel solid on your head, and even though there’s lots of plastic, they don’t feel flimsy. They may not have the same comfort level as the 580 or 600 models, but at this price point, a luxurious fit is a bit much to expect. I think Sennheiser hit the important marks very well and made excellent design decisions for the price point.","Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2018",AFRQMWJLIXBUIC2GHO4A2ZVM63NA,True,36,Style: New ModelPattern: Headphone
R12WPJLO6VUV24,B00IT0IHOY,5.0 out of 5 stars Exceptional balance for mixing music,Amazon Customer,5,"I bought these and a pair of Sony MDR-7506 and they arrived on the same day. I already own Slate VSX and Audio-Technica AT-M50x so I wanted to test all headphones on professional recordings with and without correction software utilizing Waves NX Ocean Ways Nashville and Slate VSX.I listened to ""Tonight, Tonight"" by Smashing Pumpkins focusing on the percussion and strings against the simple and tasteful bass.I listened to ""When I'm Small"" by Phantogram for the dynamics/stereo imaging qualityI listened to ""Wasted Times"" by The Weeknd to test bass/low-end hype.This particular model is relatively flat with a slight bump in the low-end and a mild boost around 7KHz as well which make it a modest set for mixing and certainly a great pickup at the pricepoint.When compared to the 7605, which have a significantly more hyped high-end and similar bass boost, the Sennheiser's easily win the contest for more accurate mixing headphones.That being said, the M50x have a similar frequency response to the Sennheiser but with better overall clarity and if you can afford to spend the extra money, they are a better set for mixing.For significantly more money you can have the significantly more accurate Slate VSX, which, coupled with the software, provide an amazing experience for mixing.However, with the aid of Waves NX Ocean Ways Nashville correcting software, the Sennheiser become astonishingly close to the VSX, with just that extra clarity which the HD280 pro seem to lack, even compared to the Sony.The last point of discussion is the comfort of these headphones. They are tight on my head, and I wear a size 7 3/8 fitted cap so my head isn't especially huge. You can adjust them to get a little more relief but if comfort is important to you, the Sony are probably the most comfortable to wear of all four sets. I certainly would not want to wear these continuously for a long time.For the price, these are quality. Add Waves NX software and they're exceptional sounding but tight on the noggin and lacking a bit of clarity.","Reviewed in the United States February 3, 2021",AE5VAUL5XDDBRR7HJCM5LVQWUX7Q,True,1,Style: New ModelPattern: Headphone
R22ZBEHIIPFTR1,B00IT0IHOY,5.0 out of 5 stars Phenomenal,Tyler,5,"I got these headphones for a gift and I am in love with them...I might marry them. I've owned the eh150s and the 202s. I also currently own the pmx680s for when I'm on the go or when I'm yogging. Obviously the HD280s blow all these out of the water.Construction ***** - Just picking these up off the table can give you the reassurance that these headphones will last a long time. Every bit of them is thick and solid...the headband, the cups and the cord. (the manual will explain how to replace pieces of your headphones if anything ever gets damaged)Comfortableness ***** - The headphone padding is thick and the ear cups are the perfect thickness. I've worn these for hours and never had any uncomfortable pains. (I have a big head too)Convenience ***** - The hd280s can fold up in three different methods which can be shown in the manual when you purchase them. They fold up two different ways and they can also lay flat due to the cups rotating 90 degrees.The Cord ***** - The cord is a very important element to me when purchasing headphones. I prefer to have a coiled cord to avoid lengthy messes. This cord is the perfect length and the thickness will put you at ease if your worried about cord damage. The area where the cord enters the headphones seems to be well constructed. The gold mini jack has a 1/4"" adapter that screws on for stereo use.The Sound ***** - Most importantly is the sound quality. They are loud and they are tight. The fact that they're tight means that ambient noise has trouble getting in. The bass is crisp but not overwhelming. The overall sound is not as dark as the 202s were, which is a good thing. After listening to many songs on my iPod I have noticed that I could hear things that I've never heard before I got these.Overall the Sennheiser HD280 Pros are the best headphones I have ever owned and I don't plan on ever replacing them until many years from now. Unless you're an audiophile (which I am not) than I don't see the point in spending any more than what these headphones cost. Only a trained ear could be as nit-picky to prefer a more expensive set of headphones. I use these headphones for video recording, whether they're plugged directly into the camera or into my Zoom h4n. They work perfect for field recording as well as in the studio when editing.I highly recommend the Hd280s.

Over the years, I have worn many ""cans"", so I have more than a ton of experience to base my review of these headphones on. Although I have purchased a number of these, I am still using a pair that I bought around TEN YEARS AGO. I have not tried to be gentle with them, and I have never replaced a single part (although the ear pads are very worn and will be replaced soon). For those of you into the details, if you look at the specs for these, you will see that they test out to be of high quality, both in sound reproduction as well as manufacturing. But specs are specs, and specs don't always tell the truth in real life. So here it is...Pros:1)Truly professional sound reproduction. Yes, there are better cans out there... and yes, you WILL pay a LOT more for something that compares to the HD280 Pros or is better. From experience, these cans are definitely good enough to do serious mixes (serious enough to meet the standards required for final mix-down before mastering on numerous national releases).2)Very low cost, very high quality.3)Extremely comfortable. I do have a smaller head compared to a lot of heads out there, and I can wear these for a very long time before wanting to take them off and give my ears and head a break. Other studio cats with bigger heads than mine have never complained about the fit of these, either.4)Replaceable parts! Yup... even though every pair I've purchased over the years are still going strong with no issues, it's nice to know that your investment will be one that will last, even if something needs to be replaced.Cons:1) Um... Um... hmmmm ... Your head/ears can get sweaty when wearing them for long periods. But that happens with all over-the-ear cans.Some people complain that these headphones are not compact enough and are too large to use all the time. Well, ok... I wouldn't go skateboarding with a pair of these on my head, but then again, they aren't meant to be that kind of product. These do exactly what they are meant to do.If you want the most for your money without compromising in sound quality and in manufacturing standards, then these are your best bet. But don't take MY word for it... just understand that there's a reason why these are still, after all these years, a top choice of so many professionals.

The first pair had a known defect in the headband, and the plastic eventually broke. This one might have lasted a few years before that.The next pair lasted a long time after that as they fixed the headband design flaw. But, they eventually died due to damage in the wires around the folding joints in May 2018. This was from repeated and regular collapsing as it was designed to do, but maybe not on a regut basis. So, don't collapse them of you don't need to! The pleather also had mostly worn away from repeated use.I got another pair, and these worked grest as well until September 2019 when a new dog of ours decided the audio cable was great for chewing! So, definitely not a design flaw in the headphones. Then I got yet another pair, and these have yet again been just as great as all of the others.In 2008, I researched a lot for recommended headphones to use that would not leaving me feeling like I was missing out when I couldn't use speakers with a sub. These for the bill, and they don't break the bank. They're usually around $100, and that's a fantastic deal if you ask me. They're probably not technically ad good as $300 or $500+ headphones, but that's fine since I don't want to spend that much on headphones. In this price range, I think these are a phenomenal bang for your buck.There's a reason I haven't bothered looking for other headphone options over the years. I keep coming back to these. Other than the wire failure, they have never failed audibly, and sound amazing. They isolate sound mostly, but still let some ambient sound in. I prefer this over sound cancellation.And as for the pleather falling off, I recommend these as a good option to counteract the problem entirely.https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0076NKKHCI've been using those since March 2019, and I've been very satisfied!

R12OONHFL5QT2,B00IT0IHOY,5.0 out of 5 stars Exquisite,Baseball,5,"I am not the kind of person who just goes out and buys something on a whim. I do plenty of research and thoroughly search through both professional and customer reviews. It was no different when I was looking for a good pair of headphones for my bus rides that I will soon be having (Minor League baseball has plenty lengthy bus rides!). It ended up coming down between the Sony MDR-V700DJ Headphones and the Sennheiser's. Needless to say, I ended up buying the Sennheiser HD 280 Pro Headphones.When the package arrive at my house I was quite anxious to listen to these 100 dollar headphones. Many of the reviews I read said the Sony's would be better for modern music with a more bass heavy setting, while the Sennheiser's simply had good reviews about sound quality in general. My biggest concern was that the Sennheiser's would not have enough bass to satisfy my need for desire. Sure enough, I plugged them in, and there was very little bass. They were amazingly clear, however, and I heard parts in my music that I had not ever heard before. (I listen to mainly rock and grunge style of music with a little country, hip-hop, and 70's music). But I wanted the bass to start kicking in! One review I had read mentioned a ""break-in"" period for headphones. Of course, I had never heard of anything like that before, but sure enough the next day my headphones had more bass. And the day after that my headphones we fully ""broken-in"". The bass is very present, though not overpowering. If you are going to listen to rap and hip-hop all the time, I would recommend trying another pair. The bass is sufficient, there is no question about that, but my guess is there is probably another pair of headphones that are more oriented toward stronger bass.Another one of my concerns was that they were going to be extremely tight on my head. Apparently these headphones are tighter than most (I tried on my dad's Sony MDR-V600 after I got mine, and the 280's are tighter). First of all, it doesn't feel very tight to me anyway, but even if it is going to be a little tighter than the rest, I prefer it because of how much outside noise it blocks out. This means your ears will be protected because you don't have to blare your music in order to hear the whole song. Love that feature.Hopefully this review helps someone out. Surely there is another person like me out there who sits reading others' reviews before purchasing a product.

R4W52JZOM8FGO,B00IT0IHOY,5.0 out of 5 stars Very good cans,David E,5,"I spent a long time reviewing, comparing, choosing then changing my mind then ultimately settling on these cans. I needed a set of monitoring headphones for music production and general use and I’m very happy with these.Things to keep in mind:1- Comfort. These aren’t the most comfortable headphones, and they aren’t the least comfortable either. They fit snug on my head. After a while I need a rest from them. Glasses, which I use when at a monitor, increase the tightness. They are definitely usable, but fit rather tight.2- Bass. These aren’t the cans for you if you are looking for booming bass and pounding bottom end. They are neutral, as they are monitoring cans. They allow you to listen to music as it was intended, producing clear reproduction across all frequencies. You can hear all the subtle sounds typically lost on other headphones (think Beats and all their clones). Music sounds fantastic through these and you’ll notice things you may not have heard before. If the music you listen to is boomy and bass heavy, you’ll still hear it that way, just not at teeth chattering levels. Music with high dynamic range is absolutely fantastic through these.3- Build quality. The cable is long. I mean really long. And it’s coiled. Some prefer this, some don’t. I do although would have been happier if it was a tad shorter. My preferences though. Also, I’ve read numerous reviews of the jack breaking off as it’s build in this area seems to be a bit weak. I haven’t had this problem and hope not too, yet time will tell.All in all I’d say these are an excellent purchase in the sub-$150 range. I broke mine in by leaving them plugged into my stereo for 4-5 days while music of various types played. They sound heavenly.

Also, new plastic used to manufacture makes the cord much less flexible so the coiled cord just sits as a unit and doesn't stretch as easily as the old. I prefer the plastic used on the old model much better. Sound-wise, it's hard to tell starting out with new headphones. They need time to loosen up in order to give their best performance. But after about 60 hours of use I'd say the new just don't sound quite as good as the old model. Base not quite there. It seems, again, that the different (cheaper?) plastic material or other (cheaper?) materials might have something to do with the sound not being quite up to par with the old model. While the new model 280s haven't broken, they just feel like they're more likely to than the old model. The new model plastic looks cool but feels cheaper, more fragile. I can notice no significant difference in the headband cushion on the new. It has a gap in it. That's the only difference. The real issue with the headband cushion was not the cushion but the cheap plastic seal on top that eventually splits open and drops the whole cushion assembly off. I was disappointed to see Sennheiser didn't fix that with the new model. It's the same weak, split top to the top cushion pad assembly for your head. Sound isolation seems the same for old and new - both very good; well above average. I use them about 5 hours a day. I find I have to take them off three or four times to let the ears breathe and rub my ear area. But I wouldn't say they're very uncomfortable. They need to be somewhat tight to get the sound isolation necessary. Having said all that, either old or new are a great value. I've used the old model 280s for 10 years for professional monitoring and personal music listening and have been very pleased. My old cans were the very fine Panasonic RP-HT355s (no longer available) and prior to that the Radio Shack LV-10s (also no longer available and about as good as the 280s - perhaps better in some ways). I was given a pair of Grado SR-60s a couple years ago but was disappointed. The 280s easily have the SR-60s beat. So, until you have $400+ to spend on headphones, stick with the Sennheiser 280 Pros ~and~ stick with the old model.","Reviewed in the United States April 25, 2017",AHEKSSNYKSDGB4RQPOIUVLARNXZA,True,5,Style: New ModelPattern: Headphone

RMNDY5CDZ6MH6,B00IT0IHOY,5.0 out of 5 stars Portable - Durable - Lovable,Breece,5,"After two and a half years, I still bring these headphones with me everywhere! I know there have been complaints about the plastic breaking in different areas, but even after stuffing them into my backpack, taking them out and stuffing them back in several times a day, they still work like new. -In high school, I wore these things every day in my computer classes. -In college, I have worn them every day during my commute to and from school to listen to music and Youtube videos. As a motion design student, I often use my headphones during classes so that I am not disturbing other students with the sounds of my current project (or just to block out the noise coming from other people's computers.) Although they get hot after wearing them for a long time, these things are surprisingly comfortable. Sometimes, when I am listening to music, my playlist will end and I will continue to wear the headphones because I'm so focused that I don't realize there is no longer any music playing. -I even took them to Japan when I went on a study abroad trip last summer. I wore them on the plane to watch a movie, and used them several times during the trip. In Japan, I found out that a student I was rooming with had the same headphones! I love these things.ANYWAY, lets do the good-ol' Pro/Con thing:PROS:-Portable (just be sure to extend the headband all the way before collapsing)-Durable (I even sat on them once, although I may have been very lucky. I don't recommend testing their strength!)-Comfortable (I happen to love around-the-ear headphones. If you don't like this style, then these may not be for you)-Adjustable-Coiled CordCONS:-They do get hot after a while. This bothers some people more than others-It IS plastic, which means it can break if you're not careful-The pad on the headband isn't attached to anything and just sort of grips the band. It may fall off, but its easy to put back on-Although they are portable, they are kind of big-Sometimes I feel silly wearing them in public :PI am not too picky when it comes to sound quality, so for me these headphones are ""more than good enough."" These are definitely MY favorite headphones for listening to my music. I know that some people really like the sound quality and some people say it's ""okay.""

REBW4VSPT5EC1,B00IT0IHOY,4.0 out of 5 stars Perfect for the studio... less perfect for the stereo,M. Friedman,4,"While not perhaps the ""gold standard"" of studio headphones, the HD-280s are certainly the price/performance champion. The frequency range of 8 - 25000 Hz (that is, beyond the typical range of human hearing) is almost unknown at this pricepoint and although you probably won't actually HEAR anything below 20 Hz and above 20,000 Hz, it helps keep the signal from being distorted. In fact, these headphones feature some of the truest, clearest, and most detailed sound that my 50-year-old ears have enjoyed. (I readily admit that things might sound different with younger ears.) The response is flat -- which is nice for mixing, and for listening to classical music, but probably not what you want for hiphop and house.While the HD-280s do not feature any active noise-cancelling technology, they are very well-insulated, and do a very good job of blocking out extraneous sound and, conversely, of keeping the sound of whatever you are listening to to yourself. There is less sound leakage with these headphones (I also have the Audio Technica ATH-M30x and SONY MDRV6 for comparison). While perhaps not the perfect studio headphones, the HD-280s are not far from it.That does not necessarily mean that they are near-perfect for other uses. They are bulky, and hard enough to carry for portable and mobile listening. Some of the features that make the HD-280 ideal in the studio, moreover, make them a little less-than-perfect fo home-audio listening. For example, the outstanding sound insulation creates rather more pressure on the ears that even the ATH-M30x or MDRV6, which can be uncomfortable for extended listening, and reduces some of the depth and expansiveness of the music. The old Audio-Technica ATH-M40fs features a vent that produces some leakage, but improves the depth and reduces pressure.The bottom line is that, if you are looking for studio headphones, the HD-280 is almost perfect. If you are looking for home-audio headphones for classical music or jazz, then you should probably look for a more open design.And, yes, they do fit a little snugly. That is one of te reasons why they do not produce much sound leakage. However, the tighness relaxes a bit after repeated uses. I wear a size 7-1/2 hat, and I find the HD-280 as comfortable as any other studio headphones except the MDRV6.To recap: Perfect for the studio... less perfect for the stereo. But excellent all-around headphones. I would give the HD-280 4.5 stars if I could.","Reviewed in the United States March 17, 2015",AH437ZCN6KLOC3ULMHD4XGXQOKHA,True,11,Style: Old ModelPattern: Headphone

R2L3WTNZFFQSZ8,B00IT0IHOY,5.0 out of 5 stars True love,phototr0pe,5,"I like to think of myself as a broke audiophile. So, when I managed to snag a pair of these on sale around the holidays, I was pretty excited.The sound is very, very impressive, as I would expect. First, here's where I was coming from: I typically use a little $300 bookshelf stereo unit as the sound system for my computer, with two 60-watt speakers, two drivers each. This unit gets surprisingly good sound for its age and cost, whether I am playing music that requires high fidelity (violin sonatas, for example) or music with heavy bass (electronic music, for example).I have to say these headphones are actually more atmospheric in sound than the stereo unit. It's like being in your own tiny monitoring room with amazing sound reproduction and acoustics. Sounds in video games (like an enemy sneaking up from behind) startle me like never before due to just how real they seem, and the fidelity of sound is so real and so crisp that I keep thinking what I'm hearing must be from outside my room--but upon removing the headphones I realize that I'm hearing things in the music that I'd never heard before.They do apply a good amount of force to your head. The circumaural ear cushions are fantastically comfortable, and after adjusting them I can even wear them with glasses without any serious discomfort. However before adjusting them I would get light headaches due to the clamping force after a few hours of listening. I do have a small head so if you have a large one your mileage may vary.Additionally, speaking as an engineer, I can say that the frequency response curve of these babies is superb. The ideal frequency response for headphones is generally taken to be one that is flat from the lowest to highest frequencies in the human hearing range--that is, it reproduces exactly what it's given without any attenuation. Take a look at the frequency response for these and I know you'll be impressed. I've never seen anything quite so good for the price. (If you're looking for something to artificially boost your bass look elsewhere, though of course you can always do that via a software equalizer.)In summary--these are the best sounding units I have ever used and they are quite comfortable after adjustment. If you're looking for some good mid-/high-level audiophile headphones, these are definitely a winner.","Reviewed in the United States February 23, 2012",AFVNC57LQG5AAZV32MU7DUXSNBXA,True,9,Style: Old ModelPattern: Headphone
R2SGM1RXOZSAV2,B00IT0IHOY,5.0 out of 5 stars A.M.A.Z.I.N.G!,Kell Baker,5,"No, I didn't just read an entire blogs worth of bad reviews on these headphones did I???!!! Sheesh audio maniacs, you can't be serious!I am lost at how people can find anything to complain about. The low impedance of 64 ohms, a sound projection level above 113dB and an FR of 8Hz to 25kHz are pretty amazing specs. Go get a pair of Dr. Dre beats if you want your brain to melt! These are professional quality headphones used for critical monitoring purposes. That being said, they are extremely rich, and require some use for the drivers to burn in (LIKE ALL HEADPHONES). When you get your pair, let music play through them for say, a solid couple of days. That should help. Shouldn't everyone who is considering dropping $100 bucks on a set of phones know this stuff? Do I need to open an Amazon Audio School for insane Audiophiles?The comfort of these cans is unsurpassed. Even after lengthy use. They are adjustable for crying out loud! I have a hat size of 7 5/8 and am nowhere near the full adjusted level, so all that talk is ludicrous.Out of the box these headphones sound amazing, but once the drivers are burned in and the full range of audio is apparent, you won't believe your ears. I had to have a pair of these after I used a pair of broken in 280s in the past, and was stunned by their performance. The sound range was so utterly amazing that I dropped 20 bucks on a pair of much maligned 201s to tie me over while I waited for my Amazon order to arrive. I will say the 201s were definitely mass consumer quality, and cheaply constructed, but the sound quality once the drivers were set was very nice. Even for cheapies.I needed a pair of comfy cans, that fit snug on my head, sturdy enough for the studio, collapsible, trustworthy and expertly built with high quality audio sound design in mind. Sennheiser 280 Professionals hit home runs in each catagory and IMO are the only way to go.In short, for those of you who got burned by Chinese knock offs or just can't be satisfied in general, all I can really say is, let them burn in in order to appreciate their true essence, and for the love of all things true and right in the world stop with the whining.

I took a chance and I absolutely love these. First thing that I liked was the coiled cord. Sooo much easier to deal with. My older ones always got tangled. Comfort is outstanding for me. lots of padding and not as tight on the head. Sound quality is very good as well.

R1VAREI4VJRPFK,B00IT0IHOY,"5.0 out of 5 stars Great Headphones, Great Price",Enthusiast,5,"After searching for a pair of 'over-the-ear' wireless headphones with decent sound quality (for under $125), I ended up coming back to a corded pair of headphones. After purchasing and returning quite a few other brands, I settled on the Sennheiser HD-280 Professional Headphones.There were enough reviews on Amazon for me to feel comfortable with the purchase and the price was almost $50 less than what I found at Fry's Electronics for the exact same pair. One of the main selling points for me was the easily replaceable parts (cord & earpads) as I plan on keeping them for quite awhile. Another plus for me was the heavier coiled cord. A few of the headphones that I purchased (and returned) had very flimsy cords that looked like they were asking to be ripped out or crimped at the first opportunity.Now that I have been listening to them for about 3 weeks, I would absolutely recommend them to anyone. First, the earpad completely encloses my ears, as it should. But you would be surprised to find out just how many supposedly 'over-the-ear' headphones actually rest on some part of your ear because they are too small. They are lightweight, or at least as lightweight as a pair like this can be, and they are comfortable. Yes, they were a little tight at first, but if you read the instructions, that is the way they are designed. The pressure is there to keep the headphones pressed against your ear to eliminate as much external noise as possible; which it does.The sound is incredible. The wireless headphones that I was looking at just could not come close to the full range and clarity of sound that these provide. I am hearing new sounds in most of the soundtracks that I listen to while working that I never heard in my previous headphones (IR wireless, on-the-ear). I am looking forward to listening to all of my music with a renewed interest as a result.The headphones are also collapsible, which is not much of a selling point for me. I would actually prefer that they weren't, as I am not looking for portability in a full-size pair of headphones. Hopefully the extra 'joints' that make it collapsible won't prove to be a weak point as opposed to it being solid construction.If you are contemplating these headphones, just look at the numbers posted here on Amazon to see just how many people have enjoyed these headphones.

After all this time and use, I have two main impressions. First is that the sound quality is fantastic. Second, they fit very tight, which is good and bad.This was my first purchase of higher-end headphones and at the time I was not skilled in understanding how to best utilize them. I mostly used them when on the computer to watch movies, listen to music, etc. When I first got them I thought they were just okay and was disappointed based on the reviews I had read before I purchased them. The bass was weak though the sound reproduction in general was good. After breaking them in, the sound improved but I still thought the low-end of the spectrum was missing. After doing more research into them, I found several forums that talked about the great bass tones produced by the headphones and wondered what I was doing wrong. After further searching, I realized that these people were all using them with an amplifier. I also learned that computers are underpowered when it comes to running this type of headphone. After researching a lot, I found a fairly priced CMOY pocket headphone amp on ebay for around $50. I was shocked at how much better they sounded through the amp. Suddenly the lower spectrum came into focus. The day I received my pocket amp in the mail, I literally sat for a few hours listening to songs in a definition I had never heard before. I have used several high end headsets in the interim and have a really nice pair of Shure in-ear phones, but I have yet to find a set that comes close to the clarity of these. Sound-wise they are an A+.Comfort-wise I do find these to leave a bit desired. As I said above, they fit very tight. This is positive in that it helps their noise-cancelling ability. However, I am not exaggerating when I say that I have to take small breaks every half hour or so to allow the blood to flow through my temples. They feel comfortable when I first put them on and maybe I'm just a sissy, but I find long periods wearing them to be somewhat uncomfortable.","Reviewed in the United States May 13, 2011",AGFHJ2232STEV3UAGG2M63HE4WFA,True,2,Style: Old ModelPattern: Headphone

The bass is a bit too much, and the treble cuts out way too early, making their sound quality noticeably worse than a pair of mid-range earbuds to my ears. If you just want loud bass, then sure, they'll deliver that, but all sharp percussive sounds tend to come through pretty badly.Aside from that, they do cut out a lot of ambient sound despite not being actively noise-cancelling. I also found them to be extremely hot, to the point of being uncomfortable to wear for long periods, but that might be a bonus during the colder months.In general, I'm not super impressed. I feel like I could have had better sound quality and greater comfort for a quarter of the price from a pair of earbuds, which would also have the bonus of not requiring a low-impedance amplifier. Definitely would not consider these an alternative to a pair of Sony MDR-V6, either, which is a notion I've seen a lot around the internet - don't listen to the claims of similarity; they don't compare.","Reviewed in the United States August 24, 2022",AEJ5LLHS3IOJLIVO7NI3AAGYMZZA,True,2,Style: New ModelPattern: Headphone

I’ve had these headphones for 8 years now, and they’re still the very best I’ve ever used. They have been a constant in my life for nearly a decade, toughing it out in various boxes throughout various moves to different cities and states, and have never given me even a bit of trouble. They are always there and they always work.I’m not an audiophile by any means, but I do have 5-6 pairs of headphones that I cycle through for various things. Workout headphones, AirPods on the go, and a couple of high-end gaming headsets. And of course, the HD 280s. I use these on my PC… for everything. Movies, games, music, podcasts. I have no idea how to accurately describe it (again — not an audiophile) and it very well could be that I just subjectively *really like* these things, but to me they just sound infinitely better than every other headset I have ever used.The cord is a bit too long and bulky to bring these guys with me everywhere, and the headband is beginning to show it’s age a bit. Those things are replaceable, however, and they’re more than worth dealing with for what is possibly the best, most consistently excellent item (headphones or otherwise) that I have ever purchased.","Reviewed in the United States February 5, 2022",AFYKPDB3ESU5BWPVUXC6NUAISOYQ,True,4,Style: Old ModelPattern: Headphone

Worth every cent and then some.,Barkon355,5,"Took these out of the box, plugged them in and heard things I had never heard before! I've yet to use them for mixing, which is the primary reason I bought them, but until that time they are getting broken in through the stereo. I've been testing them by using some classic bands like CSN, America, Moody Blues, and others where there is a lot of play between instruments on different tracks and channels. My other headphones and earbuds are not cheap. We have another pair of Sennheisers my wife uses for listening to the TV, and we have some Sony, JBL, JVC and some others for leisure listening. I've not heard anything quite like this in this price range for ANY type of headphone or earbud, regardless of what their purpose is.One thing to be aware of, which I've seen on other reviews where ratings were lowered, is the cord. This is a vintage style, coiled cord, with a 3.5 mm male that has a 1/4 adapter that screws on. If you think that the coil will be getting in the way as some have stated, get yourself an extension cable of maybe 10 feet or so to make up for the stretch. Also, the cord is not something that can be unplugged from the headphone and replaced. It's hard wired into the earpiece. Still, not something that a few extra dollars can't fix by buying an extension for them. The sound you get from this product for the price you pay is way too good to be writing them off because of a coiled cord.In some other reviews they've been labeled as flat and without vibrancy, and granted that's not what you're buying them for. But the sound they put out is pure and simple, you hear every instrument and every note. Don't expect a driving bass that will thump you out of your chair. And don't expect the high trills to shatter your glasses (or ear drums). I can't wait to get them on the mixer and see what they're capable of! Once I do, I'll be back to update this review.

This year I decided to go A lil' bit higher end after my dog ate my 202's. So After almost a month of looking for ""better than HD202's"" I found this HD280PROs. They were a bit pricey but I got a refurbished set for 56$.The comfort: For the first couple of days I felt like they were squeezing my head, after using them for 3 continuous hrs... But I know by experience that you have to soften them a little. They feel a bit heavier than 202's, and they are, but their construction feels very rigid. Very hard plastic. This is my second week using them and I can tell they 've soften a little and feel better. Head room is huge, (I use 7 5/8 in hats) and I can tell you that I'm not even half way to the max expanding capability of these. The ear pads on these 280's are wider than the ones in the 202's. I have small ears so I have not have a problem with neither one of them, and it is very soft and thick (I can almost use it as a pillow while traveling).Sound: Quality is awesome! compared to the 202's they lack of bass but just give them aprox 3 to 5 days to break in and you will start feeling the difference. Still the low end frequency response is great and mid and highs are very crisp and clear. Now these were designed mostly for studio usage and since they are 64ohms you Ipod may struggle a bit to power them up to their full capacity. I have an Ipod Classic 160GB, I usually use it 75% volume and it is loud.Noise Cancelling: I think it is very similar to the 202's, I would say better noise cancelling since the materials used in these HD280's are thicker. Overall, IT IS GREAT!Cord: It looks very resistant and it is coiled which makes it better for such a long cord, compared to the 202's that you had to tie it around the plastic thing that came with it which was almost as heavy as the headphones. It is thicker than the 202's and comes out of the left side only which is great.Overall it is a great product and totally recommended.","Reviewed in the United States September 13, 2011",AHYLOBJFMN4EPL5U7RPRDS45Q5EA,True,3,Style: Old ModelPattern: Headphone
R3VUC5P3VUH49T,B00IT0IHOY,4.0 out of 5 stars High quality German headphones for a reasonable price,R. Ocampo,4,"I've owned various Sony and Pioneer DJ headphones. These are the most comfortable to wear, so far. A word of caution, these headphones faithfully reproduce the music. Meaning the frequency is flat - which is great! There is no discoloration, no unnecessary highs and lows. Why is this important? It will help you evaluate the real quality of your muisc source. You do your own adjustment by adding the necessary equalization setting.Sidenote: if you're looking for headphones to compliment your portable music equipment, then get the excellent Sony DJ or Bose Triport headphones which will give you colored music reproduction - extra/artificial bass and treble response. I have nothing against them, I think they are great for those needs. The only problem is that their ear pads are uncomfortable for extended use.These Senn headphones require a little bit more power to drive the speakers, so they are actualy best used for connecting to home systems that have amplification and equalization settings. I still use this for my Sony CD walkman, although I would have to crank up the volume.The plus side, parts are easily replaceable - ear pads, head pads and cord. You don't have to be afraid in using and abusing them. The German-engineered speakers (the reason you are purchasing the Sennheisers in the first place) will last.I have to warn you that the headphones will feel tight and sound bland when you first use them right out of the box. Use them constantly for a week or two and it will feel comfortable to your head. There is nothing rubbing against your ears to make you want to take it out. The environment attenuation is so great that you should NOT use it if you expect to be disturbed - phone call, door bell, etc.Why 4 stars? Better design and material should be used to make it look and feel more classy, than plastic.These are still made in Europe, so the price you are paying for is very reasonable especially when purchased from Amazon with the free shipping and tax.One last word of advice, no matter what we all say the final decision will be at the hands (or heads) of the listener. So try all the brands at your local electronics store and don't be pressured into getting one without uisng them for an extended period. Your head, ears and pocket will thank you later.","Reviewed in the United States May 26, 2003",AFRGJMSUHGKN6E36WF7NUXIQVXVQ,True,29,Style: Old ModelPattern: Headphone
R1WH5JXJB5R8Y5,B00IT0IHOY,5.0 out of 5 stars Great product! Coiled cable too heavy.,Shashe,5,"These are the first pair of reference headphones I've ever used, and I am not using them for professional use. My reason for buying them is the sound isolation. I needed headphones that do not leak sound and disturb my sleeping wife.After some research, these headphones were my best choice. They indeed isolate sound. I have a pair of ballistic ear cups rated to reduce 27 decibels, and they are built for shooting guns. These are quite comparable, meaning they keep in a similar amount of sound.I'm not even going to rate the sound quality, because I'm not using any professional equipment. I will say that it seems as close to true sound as my equipment will allow. The hdr output from one of my video games gives me a much better idea of where other players are in 3D space.As for comfort, these are quite nice. The only thing that causes discomfort is actually the cable. It is too heavy. My neck gets stiff from the subtle tilt the heavy cable induces.Which brings me to the main criticism I have of this product. The cable is a heavy duty cable with straight sections on both ends. It cannot be removed, or I would have removed it on day one. However, on day three I had to go to Amazon and buy a male to female audio cable (extender). While both ends of the cable are engineered to be quite strong, even the strongest cables will wear out with that amount of stress. The coiled section of this cable is far too heavy for its short length. Without the extender attached, these headphones are unusable due to discomfort and concern for damaging the product. So add $8-15 to the price unless you have such a cable.","Reviewed in the United States May 26, 2020",AHO5ODL43ETI2Z7GVHB67RMMXDSA,True,1,Style: New ModelPattern: Headphone

They drove me to get a subscription to Tidal Hi-fi. You'll want an amp. Nothing crazy, but PC motherboard/laptop audio for example just won't cut it. I use a Sound Blaster Omni with my work laptop and it's great. I also wouldn't use them with portable devices or Gaming Consoles.Note that they have significant clamping force on your head, but they're so well padded that it's still very comfortable to wear for hours on end. This allows for high sound pressure levels like you'd hear at a movie theater or in a car with an aftermarket sub-woofer, yet they're amazingly accurate/balanced. The highs are also perfectly crisp.Just know that once you try them, most headphones will sound somewhere from ""terrible"" to ""meh"" afterwords. I ordered a gaming headset (Game Zero) recently by the same brand, only to send them back since the mic was also defective. The plan is to get another pair of these for at home (I'll need a stand-alone mic) as soon as I'm refunded.

I went to the Sony because the 202, as much as I loved them, they did not last - but for the price, and sound, I did not care, I just couldn't find them anymore.Now, the Sony were another level, perfect sound for me (Flat sound is what ALL music lovers/creators should be the first priority!). The only thing I do not like about them is the freaking cord, which I had to attach a clip, so I can clip it to my shirt - COME ON, Sony, these are ""Pro"", freaking make a detachable cord!Now, the Seinhere cord is marginally better (shorter but stiffer), and the sound is very close to the Sony...but...1. For using them on my computer, the Sony are more comfortable, because the Sennheiser are just too tight - Yes, I have a large head, but my wife also things they are too tight.2. I would say, under close comparison, the Sony are a little more ""bright"", in a pleasing way. Or, that the Sennheiser are a little more ""dead"", in a not-as-pleasing way. Make what you want out of it.As I have not used them as such, I wouldn't compare them out in the field, but overall, I would say that, next time I buy another pair, it would be....the Sony.

R1XF2U55RMRHTN,B00IT0IHOY,5.0 out of 5 stars Sennheiser HD280 Pro Headphones,nachnaabichhoo,5,"I received my headphones today and hoped that they would be what I needed to be able to listen to Old Time Radio Programmes on a small USB MP3 Player. The plug for the cable fit perfectly! I love how I just had to unscrew it from the showing larger plug. It also fit into my lap top, and a Dr. J Portable DVD/CD Player that I purchased from Amazon as well.The sound is good. They are NOT noise cancelling. I have Sennheiser HDR170 wireless headphones that are supposed to be noise cancelling and closed back, as the HD280 Pros are supposed to be, and they are not also.I read that people mentioned that when they moved the cable, it made noise in the reception. I don't hear any kind of static, but when I touch the headphones or the cable, I hear a deep noise which is invasive, but they are not wireless, so I expected to sit in place when I listened with them.The old radio broadcasts I planned to take with me and listen to while riding the bus, or sitting in the park. I know, this makes me sound very old. My only fear of using the headphones is some unscrupulous person admiring them, and think that I should make a present of them to them. Not to worry. I just looked at them and the Sennheiser name is not printed on them like my other pair.I hope that they do not break as some other buyers said it happened to them, or that one or both headphones go out. One thing I found with my wireless headphones is that when the sound goes out on one of them, the battery is loose. I just push it back in and it works.Over all, tonight, I like them.

R2CM006AE5NWH5,B01HETFPUE,5.0 out of 5 stars ... got these in yesterday so I can’t write a great review YET,Placeholder,5,"I just got these in yesterday so I can’t write a great review YET.First, I can’t believe I spent $200 on a pair of headphones but I do use my headphones a LOT so I was able to justify the splurge.This is the first pair of “high end” headphones that I’ve bought so my experience is limited. I’m comparing mostly to LG HBS850.The first thing I noticed was how big the ear pieces are. They are pretty large and protrude out of your ears quite a bit. The LG ear piece is tiny in comparison(see image). I thought there would be no way the things were staying in my ears, however, they are MUCH more comfortable than the LG ear pieces. I didn’t even realize how uncomfortable the LGs were. The Bose ear piece doesn’t actually go inside your ear canal like the LG does. With this type of earpiece, the Bose is not quite noise canceling(nor is it supposed to be).Some of the reviews say the Bose don’t get loud enough. Since they don’t actually go inside the ear canal and create a seal like the LGs and other internal earbuds do, it does seem like they don’t get quite as loud, however, they do get plenty loud. They just don’t get so loud that it hurts. If you want that, youu probably should go with the Beats.They connected to my iPhone 7 effortlessly. A mere click( we’ll more of a mushy push) of the power button and voila there it was on my phone.Then came the sound test. Oh my goodness!! They sound amazing. I can’t believe the difference in the sound quality between these and the LGs.It’s like the difference in monaural and stereophonic sound. The bass is very strong. I’m no techy person so I can’t really go into detail about how great the sound is but it is amazing.So that’s about all I can say for now.

R2IEZBUP41NM10,B01HETFPUE,5.0 out of 5 stars Nice sounding workout headphones,Buzz D.,5,"Purchased these prior to running the 48 mile RunDisney “Dopey Challenge” series in Florida and have zero complaints.

The heart rate monitor worked flawlessly with RunKeeper with no additional setup (I didn’t even know this was an included feature, so it was a pleasant surprise!)I’ve been running events since 2013 and have tried most of the big brands; yurbuds have been my go-to for most of this time.

This pair exhibits none of these problems.First impressions: these sound *great*! Not quite as good as my wired Bose in-ear phones (as one would expect), but vastly superior to the muddy response of the Yurbuds models. Crisp highs, mellow mid, and rich bass. Awesome.No complaints about battery life, they still had plenty of juice left after I finished my full marathon.I have seen some complaints regarding ruggedness of the control buttons; I tend not to mess with these things while I’m running, but they seem to be standing up to my occasional poking without issue.","Reviewed in the United States March 26, 2019",AHPD5ODNTMPHSBBX6HLJJK3B6D2Q,True,0,Color: Power Red
R1FTF4PGDFBTQJ,B01HETFPUE,"1.0 out of 5 stars Perfect headphones, for your worst enemy",Hedley Lamarr,1,"Let me just get this out of the way now: I despise these headphones.The sound quality is great. The headphone delivery bass which few sports oriented headsets ever deliver on. They are also very comfortable on your ears. Be sure to seat the rubber mold in the folds and ridges of your ears and they won't give you any fit trouble.However they are functionally worthless. I've had expensive headphones die after 3 months that didnn't piss me off as much as these things do every single day. The problem is that ridiculous cable between the ear buds. Unlike the original SoundSport's cable which is smooth and slick, the cable on the Pulse is tacky to the touch and grabs at your skin. The end result is that the slack in the cable will drag to one side (usually the right since it has the weight of the controls). Thus stretching the cable tight across the left side of your neck up to your left ear. Turn and look to the right and the ear bud will pop out. The cable is too tacky to slide along the skin! And forget about any sort of weight lifting or mat work. You'll rip this horrible things off your head and pummel them to expensive dust with a dumbbell out of sheer rage.You may think this isn't a problem when simply running in a straight line. The next time your run, consciously track how often your turn your head to look at your surroundings. Run through an urban setting with roads and intersections. Track how often you turn your head to check for traffic. You would be amazed how many times you find this thing getting bound up in a single mile of running. You'll spend most of your time with your hands on your ears pushing the ear buds back in and trying to center that cable on your neck. It's hard to focus on form, breathing, and stride length when your hands are constantly at the sides of your head. I suppose you could lube up your neck with Vaseline to make it slick!And don't get me started on that goofy shirt clip. The clip itself wedges itself onto the cable. It doesn't spin freely around the cable. So if you don't get clip centered perfectly, or if your shirt is loose enough that it moves across your shoulders while you move, the clip will always be out of position. It's not like everyone runs in a sports bra or a skin tight shirt that doesn't wiggle or move, Bose. The clip is just as worthless as the headphones.I bought these horrible things in November so it's too late to return them now. I'd throw them away if they didn't cost me $200. I've ripped them off my head and nearly tossed them in the ditch while running more times than I can count. It simply doesn't matter how good they sound when they're functionally unusable. The slick cable of the original SoundSport appears to be fine. My friend loves hers. This tacky textured cable make the SoundSport Pulse an absolute curse. For the extra $50, you're only buying yourself a headache. Do yourself a favor and buy literally anything but these headphones and you'll be much happier with your purchase. Or give them to your competition instead! They'll be so distracted messing with these things on the race course that you'll easily pass them. Though you may not set a PR since you'll be laughing so hard at their misfortune.","Reviewed in the United States January 18, 2019",AFYEMJQDXUNWCDPXCUVR4U23IJSA,True,19,Color: Power Red
R329QN95CVMU1M,B01HETFPUE,4.0 out of 5 stars Almost perfect but not for me,Mark Nosrati,4,"Quick disclaimer. I did not buy my set from Amazon. I received mine as a Christmas gift from my mom who purchased it from Nebraska furniture Mart.First off sound quality is slightly below the previous generation's wired version. That being said, it's Bose and it's still insanely better than the next competition in line. With the volume on full blast, it's very difficult to hear any ambient noise around you. I particularly do not want to hear any noise. Especially, when I'm at the gym because they gym usually has music playing that I don't care for. However, if you're a runner or biker and you're out in traffic you'd want to hear cars passing by. So you'll need to turn them down to about 80%. You'll get crystal clear sound but you will still be able to hear the environment around you. It is wireless so it's not going to give you the same pristine sound quality as a wired set. Nevertheless, the fact that it's wireless, the sound quality is amazing. I often forget that it's wireless. It's that good!Next up is battery life. It's amazing. Although I did notice that my iPhone's battery drained a little faster. Obviously, I don't know why I forgot to expect that. Before, the wired version didn't need to connect to BlueTooth so my phone's battery life stayed full longer. Any BlueTooth device that's connected to your phone is going to use slightly more battery not just in the headset but also on your phone. So you just have to remember to keep your devices near full charge if you plan on hitting a workout later. I usually keep a backup battery charger on me and that takes care of those issues. The best part about the battery is that it charges very quickly. The battery was at 80% and in 15 minutes it was fully charged. The only downside is that there's no progress bar. So you can't connect to the app to see where the battery level is while it's charging. So you have to unplug it from the charger, turn it on, open the app, then you can see the battery level. It would have been amazing if I could just connect to the app and see the battery level while it's charging. Maybe I'm being a little too picky but I don't always need my devices to be 100% fully charged. I'm perfectly content with 98%. In fact, I often hear that overcharging a device can hurt the battery life in the long run. I'm not sure if that's true but I try to play it safe and always quickly unplug my devices when they're near full charge.Finally, comfort. This is where I'm experiencing some issues. Wearing this set makes my ears a little sore. More so than the previous wired version. The headset does come with three changeable sizes; small/medium/large rubber covers. You may be familiar with these if you've owned the wired versions. Out of the box, the mediums are already on them. I tried those for a while, then switched to the small and still my ears were sore after only wearing them for an hour. Now as a good rule, you want to give your ears a break from audio headphones. It's not good for your ears to have loud audio being blasted into them for long periods of time. Your eardrums need a break from time to time. But I'm not talking about listening to audio for long periods of time. I'm talking about just leaving the headphones in while there's no audio playing. That's what's making my ears sore. My only solution is to immediately remove them from my ears if there's no audio playing to give my ears a break. And by ears, I mean the outermost where the headset rests on, not the internal part of my ears like the eardrums. I tried to take off the old pieces from my wired set but they don't fit the wireless version. I have some time to try to get used to them but I'm worried that I won't and I may have to return them for this reason. I'm really bummed out because the wired versions felt like clouds. The comfort level was unparallel. I think it's just the shape of my ear. I simply don't expect Bose to make a headset that fits everyone's ears perfectly. But let there be no doubt that these headphones do not fall all. Just like the wired ones, you really have to yank them out for them to fall out of your ear. Once you nudge them in, they're there for good. So you can run, jump, lay down, roll over, you name it, and they stay put. Really remarkable. If these fit your ears and they're comfortable then I think $199.00 is awesome considering the fact it comes with a heart rate monitor that notifies you via voice command so you never have to look down to your watch or heart rate monitor. Just not sure how accurate it is. But it's okay that it's not perfectly accurate. As long as it's consistent. That I don't know. Anyways, hope everyone enjoys their headset as much as I've enjoyed the previous wired versions.","Reviewed in the United States January 1, 2017",AGGSB7KYAE4N3KY3B77FIQQ7T6DA,True,6,Color: Power Red

R279K8F216UUD3,B01HETFPUE,3.0 out of 5 stars I wasn't interested in waiting for Apple's new bluetooth headphones as I don't like the design of the wired equivalents that are,M.,3,"I purchased these a few months after buying my iPhone 7 and after reading up on several bluetooth headsets. I wasn't interested in waiting for Apple's new bluetooth headphones as I don't like the design of the wired equivalents that are packed in with the phone as it is, and i'd previously been primarily relying on my Bose QC20i's, which I could no longer use without an adapter (I have yet to use an adapter that doesn't break within a few weeks).I settled on these headphones for a few reasons:1. I've owned many Bose headphones over the years and have yet to find another pair that matches them in audio quality for my use cases (music while in transit, music while working out, listening/talking on conference calls and videoconferences).2. I wasn't super interested in having headphones consisting of a solid ""collar"" with earbuds connected by wires.3. Bose headphones seem to fit best into my ear canal. I hate earphones that consist of a cylinder you stick in your ear.4. I opted for this model (the HR model) because I thought it would augment my Apple watch with some additional heart rate information while working out.After using them extensively for all of my use cases, i'd rate them at about a 3.5 out of 5. (Choosing a 3 since I can't choose a half-star, and I don't think they are a 4). Here's why:- I don't need the heart rate functionality (there doesn't seem to be a way to use both the Apple Watch and these headphones, at least not with the apps I use). When I have attempted it to use it, I find that my headphones frequently become dislodged, at which point the headphones are constantly asking me to adjust one earbud or the other (usually the left) - that is beyond annoying. Had I chosen the non-HR version, I could have used the extra hour of battery life.- The quality is good, but I can still tell the difference between these and my QC20i's - these sound a little more ""digitized"". It's good enough, but i'd love to see it get closer to the wired headphones.- As far as pairing goes, they have been pretty good - you can pair to multiple devices and it seems to auto-connect when you expect it to.- The microphone seems to be great - no issues on calls.- Because the battery(ies?) are in the earbuds, they do stick out quite a bit, which can look a bit weird, and can cause them to become slightly dislodged.Overall, these are decent for heavy use. Had I gone with the non-HR version i'd probably give them a 4. I'm hoping that future revisions have slightly less bulky earbuds and slightly better audio quality.","Reviewed in the United States January 30, 2017",AEFG5ANYIQJRLFTOV3KT7ND5PGHA,True,4,Color: Power Red
RAXJ2BD058R31,B01HETFPUE,"4.0 out of 5 stars So far, very good",B. Reingold,4,"I will compare these to the Jabra Sport Pulse, which is a very similar in-ear HRM retailing for about $100 (half the price of the Bose SoundSport Pulse Wireless). I have been using the Jabra for almost two years. There are at least two recent professional online reviews comparing these two products (search ""Bose Jabra pulse review"") , but here is my personal view:Fit: ok. The Bose tips feel like they are going to fall out of your ears, but they don't. Still, not as secure a feeling as the Jabra tips.Sound: Bose sound is better, richer, deeper. BTW: I have been using the Jabra with Comply 200 foam ear tips, which provide much better sound than the standard tips that comes with Jabra. I am. told the latest model of Jabra comes equipped with Comply tips.HRM accuracy: Bose and Jabra use the same Valencell optical sensor, so performance is very close. I compared the Bose product to a Polar chest strap HRM over a 75 minute work out and found the average heart rate measurements essentially identical (difference of only one BPM).Apps: Big difference. The Bose app is a joke. In fact Bose encourages you to use its HRM with one of the commercial fitness apps like Endomondo, Strava, RunKeeper, etc., instead of the Bose app. Jabra's fitness app is great. It measures resting pulse rate and VO2 max levels to provide precise fitness zone measurements, tracks your level of effort, etc. Jabra also has a sound app that downloads your iTunes library and plays it through a Dolby sound system. You can use the sound app without the Jabra fitness app. Very cool.Durability: The Jabra Sport Pulse would be a hands down better value for the money but for the fact that (as noted in many Amazon reviews) users report the device dying without warning after three or four months of use. And that was my unhappy experience. Several times. There is a moisture problem Jabra has never been able to fix. The Jabra service people are nice enough about sending you a new device within the one year warranty period, but it's very disappointing.I bought the Bose product hoping to find a more durable product. The first Bose SoundSport release experienced similar moisture problems and had to be recalled by Bose this summer. The SoundSport Pulse model is supposed to incorporate improved waterproofing capability. Time will tell. I will report back in about six months.","Reviewed in the United States November 30, 2016",AEVPWSUL7G7XFHPPHU6RJEAPGYAA,True,5,Color: Power Red
RRHHX6Y7PK0W6,B01HETFPUE,"4.0 out of 5 stars Good Sound, Good Heartrate Monitor, But Needed Replaced After ~1.5 Years",Owen C. Marshall,4,"For the most part, I have really enjoyed these earbuds. This was my first experience using something other than over the ear headphones, so there was a learning curve that more experienced users would not have.I started off using the wrong size earpiece, not realizing that a different size would stay in my ears better. (I do not remember whether I had put in something too large or too small.) When I realized my mistake, oh! What a difference that made.I bought the earbuds to help me as I trained for my first marathon. I ran with them in light, spring rains and hot, summer sun. I ran for up to five hours at a time with no problems from my battery. The sound quality has been fine (though I am not an audiophile). And the Bose app allows the heartrate monitor to connect to my preferred fitness app.My experience has not been perfect however.- The clip with which one could connect the wire to one's shirt or jacket to keep it out of the way, fell off while I was on a 10 mile (16.1 km) run.- In order for my fitness app to notice the heartrate monitor, I must first connect to the Bose app. Then, I must switch to my fitness app and wait for it to notice the heartrate monitor is available. Unfortunately, sometimes the Bose app turns off the monitor when I switch away to a different app. So I have to start the process again. This can take several tries before I successfully get the setup to work.- Finally, although I keep the earbuds in their charging case when I am not using them and do not expose them to excessive wear, the outer silicone casing came loose and the buds ceased charging after about a year and a half. Fortunately, I purchased the extended warranty and they repaired my buds at no charge. But that is something to keep in mind.","Reviewed in the United States December 30, 2019",AFGVGSEZWOACPCTAKX5B3PWRR33Q,True,1,Color: Power Red

Decided to change out for these for my workouts. I like them, but don't love them. So here's the pros:1. They really are comfortable. The size and weight people pooh pooh on aren't really noticeable.2. Sound quality is really good. They don't approach my Sennheiser's but I didn't expect them to. That being said, the bass reproduction which I'm a stickler on was crisp and sounded good at lower levels although at higher listening levels, it was weak IMO.3. The HR monitor is awesome. I've been using a BT Polar HR monitor for years. This one is dead on accurate to that for my workouts. Better than my iWatch. So I use the HR monitor in these headphones for monitoring real workouts and my iWatch for everything else.Now for the cons:1. All the reviews about noise due to fit are dead on. They don't fit fully into the ear canal so you do get background noise. Decide whether that's important. My Sennheiser's do which is on the reasons the bass is so good.2. They're not loud enough. Because they don't fit fully into my ear and with ambient noise, I find I have to listen with the volume at max. Whereas the in-ear headphones - I've never needed to get above 1/2.Overall - I'm pleased with my purchase. I wanted headphones that let in ambient sounds when I bike ride. I wanted really good sound fidelity. These do it. I wanted the simplicity of an integrated and accurate HR monitor. Check. The only gripe I have - I just wished they would get a bit louder, but that's probably not a bad thing for my ears as I age.","Reviewed in the United States January 19, 2018",AENBU7CUSAG7LY6WOHEAYFPLIPLQ,True,14,Color: Power Red

R6CWPLRAL7KW3,B01HETFPUE,3.0 out of 5 stars Good sound. Bad HR monitor.,userx,3,"The sound is good and typical of what you might expect from Bose. Audiophiles might complain and say that they can get same/better sound quality for lower prices but as a layman, the Bose SoundSport Pulse headphones sound pretty good.One complaint is that there is virtually no noise cancellation. I wasn't expecting any active noise cancellation, but there is almost no passive noise cancellation either. This can be useful for some people, like runners who need to pay attention to their surroundings. But I usually work out at the gym, where it's a bit noisy and I have to crank up the sound a bit.The biggest negative is the heartrate monitor. It's almost worthless. I have an Android phone and tried many apps to find one that could connect to the Bose SoundSport Pulse. None connected reliably. Either they refused to connect at all (I tried many settings), or the connection was very flimsy or had other usability issues. Bose has their own app that can show the heartrate, but the app itself is feature poor with no recording or stats. I later upgraded my phone to an S8 and also didn't have much success. Eventually, I just gave up and use the SoundSport Pulse as a regular headphone.If I had listened to the other reviewers experiencing the same issues, I would have just saved the $50 and gotten the Bose SoundSport. If you want a wireless Bose headphones for $150, go with the regular SoundSport. If you're ok with forking over $300, then I recommend the QC30. I prefer the QC30 for most uses as the added noise cancellation is makes quite a difference in noisy environments.","Reviewed in the United States September 13, 2017",AFIUMGL5VVHA25AFAQ4S7I3VN2IQ,True,1,Color: Power Red

R1JJ7GO5RK620U,B01HETFPUE,2.0 out of 5 stars Don't Waste Extra Money on the Pulse Version - the Heart Rate Monitor is just a Gimmick,MTL,2,"Best sound of any wireless bluetooth that I've had. Nice volume and the bass is solid. Definitely not wired sound, but impressive enough to warrant $150 for the wireless sound.Battery lasts 7-8 hours and charges pretty quickly, so that's good.Haven't had any trouble pairing it up to my iPhone 7. So, the sound, battery and bluetooth seem pretty good, BUT I paid the extra $50 for the heart rate monitor and it's very NOT good. Here are the reasons why the heart rate function has been useless for me:1. The monitor has been unable to pick up my heart rate any time it's over 130bpm.2. The monitor has been unable to pick up my heart rate when I run, jump, ride, lift, or shovel dirt. So, basically any kind of high intensity exercise type movement (yes, shoveling dirt can be high intensity if you want it to be).3. Even when I'm not moving and my heart rate is below 130 bpm, it takes - on average - 1 1/2 minutes for the monitor to pick up my heart rate - which is very not helpful.After reading a few reviews, I had high hopes for this item because it would be great to dump the chest strap, but it is not to be.It is my opinion, and has been my experience, that if one is serious about tracking their heart rate while performing any type of strenuous exercise, this is probably not the right tool.On the other hand, if one wants good sound without wires? This is the best I've found - but save the extra $50 and buy the non-Pulse version instead.","Reviewed in the United States December 20, 2016",AG6WWMARZJ7XGD55RII2YWNAPITA,True,12,Color: Power Red

Yet, the connection remains stable eliminating noises. The heart rate monitor works fine and with no interference.When using an high volume it actually block environmental noises so be careful when using it outdoor.One thing I would wish to have is to vocally broadcasting of the heartrate from the smartphone application to the SoundSport Pulse because during the exercise it isn't so intuitive at high intensity workout to look at the smartphone screen.Is anyone aware of such of capability?

And, when these headphones are connected properly, they are finicky, the left ear bud's contact disconnecting and reconnecting without being touched.Ultimately, if you are interested in wireless bluetooth headphones, go with the Bose SoundSport Wireless Headphones, that don't have the heart rate monitor.

Sound quality is brilliant - but I would suggest think carefully if you really need the pulse monitoring, work out exactly which app you will use it with, as I found the functionality much less than fitbit/suunto.

I then called Bose and they admitted that their internal technical documentation confirms that HR data is not captured/logged in RunKeeper (just displayed) although that documentation is not available to consumers. What is available to consumers indicates that the SoundSport Pulse is compatible with RunKeeper (I guess it's up to consumers to figure out what compatible means).Good luck with your purchase should you chose to continue with it...I'm returning mine.

I’m comparing mostly to LG HBS850.The first thing I noticed was how big the ear pieces are. They are pretty large and protrude out of your ears quite a bit. The LG ear piece is tiny in comparison(see image). I thought there would be no way the things were staying in my ears, however, they are MUCH more comfortable than the LG ear pieces. I didn’t even realize how uncomfortable the LGs were. The Bose ear piece doesn’t actually go inside your ear canal like the LG does. With this type of earpiece, the Bose is not quite noise canceling(nor is it supposed to be).Some of the reviews say the Bose don’t get loud enough. Since they don’t actually go inside the ear canal and create a seal like the LGs and other internal earbuds do, it does seem like they don’t get quite as loud, however, they do get plenty loud. They just don’t get so loud that it hurts. If you want that, youu probably should go with the Beats.They connected to my iPhone 7 effortlessly. A mere click( we’ll more of a mushy push) of the power button and voila there it was on my phone.Then came the sound test. Oh my goodness!! They sound amazing. I can’t believe the difference in the sound quality between these and the LGs.It’s like the difference in monaural and stereophonic sound. The bass is very strong. I’m no techy person so I can’t really go into detail about how great the sound is but it is amazing.So that’s about all I can say for now.

R1FTF4PGDFBTQJ,B01HETFPUE,"1.0 out of 5 stars Perfect headphones, for your worst enemy",Hedley Lamarr,1,"Let me just get this out of the way now: I despise these headphones.The sound quality is great. The headphone delivery bass which few sports oriented headsets ever deliver on. They are also very comfortable on your ears. Be sure to seat the rubber mold in the folds and ridges of your ears and they won't give you any fit trouble.However they are functionally worthless. I've had expensive headphones die after 3 months that didnn't piss me off as much as these things do every single day. The problem is that ridiculous cable between the ear buds. Unlike the original SoundSport's cable which is smooth and slick, the cable on the Pulse is tacky to the touch and grabs at your skin. The end result is that the slack in the cable will drag to one side (usually the right since it has the weight of the controls). Thus stretching the cable tight across the left side of your neck up to your left ear. Turn and look to the right and the ear bud will pop out. The cable is too tacky to slide along the skin! And forget about any sort of weight lifting or mat work. You'll rip this horrible things off your head and pummel them to expensive dust with a dumbbell out of sheer rage.You may think this isn't a problem when simply running in a straight line. The next time your run, consciously track how often your turn your head to look at your surroundings. Run through an urban setting with roads and intersections. Track how often you turn your head to check for traffic. You would be amazed how many times you find this thing getting bound up in a single mile of running. You'll spend most of your time with your hands on your ears pushing the ear buds back in and trying to center that cable on your neck. It's hard to focus on form, breathing, and stride length when your hands are constantly at the sides of your head. I suppose you could lube up your neck with Vaseline to make it slick!And don't get me started on that goofy shirt clip. The clip itself wedges itself onto the cable. It doesn't spin freely around the cable. So if you don't get clip centered perfectly, or if your shirt is loose enough that it moves across your shoulders while you move, the clip will always be out of position. It's not like everyone runs in a sports bra or a skin tight shirt that doesn't wiggle or move, Bose. The clip is just as worthless as the headphones.I bought these horrible things in November so it's too late to return them now. I'd throw them away if they didn't cost me $200. I've ripped them off my head and nearly tossed them in the ditch while running more times than I can count. It simply doesn't matter how good they sound when they're functionally unusable. The slick cable of the original SoundSport appears to be fine. My friend loves hers. This tacky textured cable make the SoundSport Pulse an absolute curse. For the extra $50, you're only buying yourself a headache. Do yourself a favor and buy literally anything but these headphones and you'll be much happier with your purchase. Or give them to your competition instead! They'll be so distracted messing with these things on the race course that you'll easily pass them. Though you may not set a PR since you'll be laughing so hard at their misfortune.","Reviewed in the United States January 18, 2019",AFYEMJQDXUNWCDPXCUVR4U23IJSA,True,19,Color: Power Red
R329QN95CVMU1M,B01HETFPUE,4.0 out of 5 stars Almost perfect but not for me,Mark Nosrati,4,"Quick disclaimer. I did not buy my set from Amazon. I received mine as a Christmas gift from my mom who purchased it from Nebraska furniture Mart.First off sound quality is slightly below the previous generation's wired version. That being said, it's Bose and it's still insanely better than the next competition in line. With the volume on full blast, it's very difficult to hear any ambient noise around you. I particularly do not want to hear any noise. Especially, when I'm at the gym because they gym usually has music playing that I don't care for. However, if you're a runner or biker and you're out in traffic you'd want to hear cars passing by. So you'll need to turn them down to about 80%. You'll get crystal clear sound but you will still be able to hear the environment around you. It is wireless so it's not going to give you the same pristine sound quality as a wired set. Nevertheless, the fact that it's wireless, the sound quality is amazing. I often forget that it's wireless. It's that good!Next up is battery life. It's amazing. Although I did notice that my iPhone's battery drained a little faster. Obviously, I don't know why I forgot to expect that. Before, the wired version didn't need to connect to BlueTooth so my phone's battery life stayed full longer. Any BlueTooth device that's connected to your phone is going to use slightly more battery not just in the headset but also on your phone. So you just have to remember to keep your devices near full charge if you plan on hitting a workout later. I usually keep a backup battery charger on me and that takes care of those issues. The best part about the battery is that it charges very quickly. The battery was at 80% and in 15 minutes it was fully charged. The only downside is that there's no progress bar. So you can't connect to the app to see where the battery level is while it's charging. So you have to unplug it from the charger, turn it on, open the app, then you can see the battery level. It would have been amazing if I could just connect to the app and see the battery level while it's charging. Maybe I'm being a little too picky but I don't always need my devices to be 100% fully charged. I'm perfectly content with 98%. In fact, I often hear that overcharging a device can hurt the battery life in the long run. I'm not sure if that's true but I try to play it safe and always quickly unplug my devices when they're near full charge.Finally, comfort. This is where I'm experiencing some issues. Wearing this set makes my ears a little sore. More so than the previous wired version. The headset does come with three changeable sizes; small/medium/large rubber covers. You may be familiar with these if you've owned the wired versions. Out of the box, the mediums are already on them. I tried those for a while, then switched to the small and still my ears were sore after only wearing them for an hour. Now as a good rule, you want to give your ears a break from audio headphones. It's not good for your ears to have loud audio being blasted into them for long periods of time. Your eardrums need a break from time to time. But I'm not talking about listening to audio for long periods of time. I'm talking about just leaving the headphones in while there's no audio playing. That's what's making my ears sore. My only solution is to immediately remove them from my ears if there's no audio playing to give my ears a break. And by ears, I mean the outermost where the headset rests on, not the internal part of my ears like the eardrums. I tried to take off the old pieces from my wired set but they don't fit the wireless version. I have some time to try to get used to them but I'm worried that I won't and I may have to return them for this reason. I'm really bummed out because the wired versions felt like clouds. The comfort level was unparallel. I think it's just the shape of my ear. I simply don't expect Bose to make a headset that fits everyone's ears perfectly. But let there be no doubt that these headphones do not fall all. Just like the wired ones, you really have to yank them out for them to fall out of your ear. Once you nudge them in, they're there for good. So you can run, jump, lay down, roll over, you name it, and they stay put. Really remarkable. If these fit your ears and they're comfortable then I think $199.00 is awesome considering the fact it comes with a heart rate monitor that notifies you via voice command so you never have to look down to your watch or heart rate monitor. Just not sure how accurate it is. But it's okay that it's not perfectly accurate. As long as it's consistent. That I don't know. Anyways, hope everyone enjoys their headset as much as I've enjoyed the previous wired versions.","Reviewed in the United States January 1, 2017",AGGSB7KYAE4N3KY3B77FIQQ7T6DA,True,6,Color: Power Red

R279K8F216UUD3,B01HETFPUE,3.0 out of 5 stars I wasn't interested in waiting for Apple's new bluetooth headphones as I don't like the design of the wired equivalents that are,M.,3,"I purchased these a few months after buying my iPhone 7 and after reading up on several bluetooth headsets. I wasn't interested in waiting for Apple's new bluetooth headphones as I don't like the design of the wired equivalents that are packed in with the phone as it is, and i'd previously been primarily relying on my Bose QC20i's, which I could no longer use without an adapter (I have yet to use an adapter that doesn't break within a few weeks).I settled on these headphones for a few reasons:1. I've owned many Bose headphones over the years and have yet to find another pair that matches them in audio quality for my use cases (music while in transit, music while working out, listening/talking on conference calls and videoconferences).2. I wasn't super interested in having headphones consisting of a solid ""collar"" with earbuds connected by wires.3. Bose headphones seem to fit best into my ear canal. I hate earphones that consist of a cylinder you stick in your ear.4. I opted for this model (the HR model) because I thought it would augment my Apple watch with some additional heart rate information while working out.After using them extensively for all of my use cases, i'd rate them at about a 3.5 out of 5. (Choosing a 3 since I can't choose a half-star, and I don't think they are a 4). Here's why:- I don't need the heart rate functionality (there doesn't seem to be a way to use both the Apple Watch and these headphones, at least not with the apps I use). When I have attempted it to use it, I find that my headphones frequently become dislodged, at which point the headphones are constantly asking me to adjust one earbud or the other (usually the left) - that is beyond annoying. Had I chosen the non-HR version, I could have used the extra hour of battery life.- The quality is good, but I can still tell the difference between these and my QC20i's - these sound a little more ""digitized"". It's good enough, but i'd love to see it get closer to the wired headphones.- As far as pairing goes, they have been pretty good - you can pair to multiple devices and it seems to auto-connect when you expect it to.- The microphone seems to be great - no issues on calls.- Because the battery(ies?) are in the earbuds, they do stick out quite a bit, which can look a bit weird, and can cause them to become slightly dislodged.Overall, these are decent for heavy use. Had I gone with the non-HR version i'd probably give them a 4. I'm hoping that future revisions have slightly less bulky earbuds and slightly better audio quality.","Reviewed in the United States January 30, 2017",AEFG5ANYIQJRLFTOV3KT7ND5PGHA,True,4,Color: Power Red
RAXJ2BD058R31,B01HETFPUE,"4.0 out of 5 stars So far, very good",B. Reingold,4,"I will compare these to the Jabra Sport Pulse, which is a very similar in-ear HRM retailing for about $100 (half the price of the Bose SoundSport Pulse Wireless). I have been using the Jabra for almost two years. There are at least two recent professional online reviews comparing these two products (search ""Bose Jabra pulse review"") , but here is my personal view:Fit: ok. The Bose tips feel like they are going to fall out of your ears, but they don't. Still, not as secure a feeling as the Jabra tips.Sound: Bose sound is better, richer, deeper. BTW: I have been using the Jabra with Comply 200 foam ear tips, which provide much better sound than the standard tips that comes with Jabra. I am. told the latest model of Jabra comes equipped with Comply tips.HRM accuracy: Bose and Jabra use the same Valencell optical sensor, so performance is very close. I compared the Bose product to a Polar chest strap HRM over a 75 minute work out and found the average heart rate measurements essentially identical (difference of only one BPM).Apps: Big difference. The Bose app is a joke. In fact Bose encourages you to use its HRM with one of the commercial fitness apps like Endomondo, Strava, RunKeeper, etc., instead of the Bose app. Jabra's fitness app is great. It measures resting pulse rate and VO2 max levels to provide precise fitness zone measurements, tracks your level of effort, etc. Jabra also has a sound app that downloads your iTunes library and plays it through a Dolby sound system. You can use the sound app without the Jabra fitness app. Very cool.Durability: The Jabra Sport Pulse would be a hands down better value for the money but for the fact that (as noted in many Amazon reviews) users report the device dying without warning after three or four months of use. And that was my unhappy experience. Several times. There is a moisture problem Jabra has never been able to fix. The Jabra service people are nice enough about sending you a new device within the one year warranty period, but it's very disappointing.I bought the Bose product hoping to find a more durable product. The first Bose SoundSport release experienced similar moisture problems and had to be recalled by Bose this summer. The SoundSport Pulse model is supposed to incorporate improved waterproofing capability. Time will tell. I will report back in about six months.","Reviewed in the United States November 30, 2016",AEVPWSUL7G7XFHPPHU6RJEAPGYAA,True,5,Color: Power Red
RRHHX6Y7PK0W6,B01HETFPUE,"4.0 out of 5 stars Good Sound, Good Heartrate Monitor, But Needed Replaced After ~1.5 Years",Owen C. Marshall,4,"For the most part, I have really enjoyed these earbuds. This was my first experience using something other than over the ear headphones, so there was a learning curve that more experienced users would not have.I started off using the wrong size earpiece, not realizing that a different size would stay in my ears better. (I do not remember whether I had put in something too large or too small.) When I realized my mistake, oh! What a difference that made.I bought the earbuds to help me as I trained for my first marathon. I ran with them in light, spring rains and hot, summer sun. I ran for up to five hours at a time with no problems from my battery. The sound quality has been fine (though I am not an audiophile). And the Bose app allows the heartrate monitor to connect to my preferred fitness app.My experience has not been perfect however.- The clip with which one could connect the wire to one's shirt or jacket to keep it out of the way, fell off while I was on a 10 mile (16.1 km) run.- In order for my fitness app to notice the heartrate monitor, I must first connect to the Bose app. Then, I must switch to my fitness app and wait for it to notice the heartrate monitor is available. Unfortunately, sometimes the Bose app turns off the monitor when I switch away to a different app. So I have to start the process again. This can take several tries before I successfully get the setup to work.- Finally, although I keep the earbuds in their charging case when I am not using them and do not expose them to excessive wear, the outer silicone casing came loose and the buds ceased charging after about a year and a half. Fortunately, I purchased the extended warranty and they repaired my buds at no charge. But that is something to keep in mind.","Reviewed in the United States December 30, 2019",AFGVGSEZWOACPCTAKX5B3PWRR33Q,True,1,Color: Power Red

Decided to change out for these for my workouts. I like them, but don't love them. So here's the pros:1. They really are comfortable. The size and weight people pooh pooh on aren't really noticeable.2. Sound quality is really good. They don't approach my Sennheiser's but I didn't expect them to. That being said, the bass reproduction which I'm a stickler on was crisp and sounded good at lower levels although at higher listening levels, it was weak IMO.3. The HR monitor is awesome. I've been using a BT Polar HR monitor for years. This one is dead on accurate to that for my workouts. Better than my iWatch. So I use the HR monitor in these headphones for monitoring real workouts and my iWatch for everything else.Now for the cons:1. All the reviews about noise due to fit are dead on. They don't fit fully into the ear canal so you do get background noise. Decide whether that's important. My Sennheiser's do which is on the reasons the bass is so good.2. They're not loud enough. Because they don't fit fully into my ear and with ambient noise, I find I have to listen with the volume at max. Whereas the in-ear headphones - I've never needed to get above 1/2.Overall - I'm pleased with my purchase. I wanted headphones that let in ambient sounds when I bike ride. I wanted really good sound fidelity. These do it. I wanted the simplicity of an integrated and accurate HR monitor. Check. The only gripe I have - I just wished they would get a bit louder, but that's probably not a bad thing for my ears as I age.","Reviewed in the United States January 19, 2018",AENBU7CUSAG7LY6WOHEAYFPLIPLQ,True,14,Color: Power Red

R6CWPLRAL7KW3,B01HETFPUE,3.0 out of 5 stars Good sound. Bad HR monitor.,userx,3,"The sound is good and typical of what you might expect from Bose. Audiophiles might complain and say that they can get same/better sound quality for lower prices but as a layman, the Bose SoundSport Pulse headphones sound pretty good.One complaint is that there is virtually no noise cancellation. I wasn't expecting any active noise cancellation, but there is almost no passive noise cancellation either. This can be useful for some people, like runners who need to pay attention to their surroundings. But I usually work out at the gym, where it's a bit noisy and I have to crank up the sound a bit.The biggest negative is the heartrate monitor. It's almost worthless. I have an Android phone and tried many apps to find one that could connect to the Bose SoundSport Pulse. None connected reliably. Either they refused to connect at all (I tried many settings), or the connection was very flimsy or had other usability issues. Bose has their own app that can show the heartrate, but the app itself is feature poor with no recording or stats. I later upgraded my phone to an S8 and also didn't have much success. Eventually, I just gave up and use the SoundSport Pulse as a regular headphone.If I had listened to the other reviewers experiencing the same issues, I would have just saved the $50 and gotten the Bose SoundSport. If you want a wireless Bose headphones for $150, go with the regular SoundSport. If you're ok with forking over $300, then I recommend the QC30. I prefer the QC30 for most uses as the added noise cancellation is makes quite a difference in noisy environments.","Reviewed in the United States September 13, 2017",AFIUMGL5VVHA25AFAQ4S7I3VN2IQ,True,1,Color: Power Red

R1JJ7GO5RK620U,B01HETFPUE,2.0 out of 5 stars Don't Waste Extra Money on the Pulse Version - the Heart Rate Monitor is just a Gimmick,MTL,2,"Best sound of any wireless bluetooth that I've had. Nice volume and the bass is solid. Definitely not wired sound, but impressive enough to warrant $150 for the wireless sound.Battery lasts 7-8 hours and charges pretty quickly, so that's good.Haven't had any trouble pairing it up to my iPhone 7. So, the sound, battery and bluetooth seem pretty good, BUT I paid the extra $50 for the heart rate monitor and it's very NOT good. Here are the reasons why the heart rate function has been useless for me:1. The monitor has been unable to pick up my heart rate any time it's over 130bpm.2. The monitor has been unable to pick up my heart rate when I run, jump, ride, lift, or shovel dirt. So, basically any kind of high intensity exercise type movement (yes, shoveling dirt can be high intensity if you want it to be).3. Even when I'm not moving and my heart rate is below 130 bpm, it takes - on average - 1 1/2 minutes for the monitor to pick up my heart rate - which is very not helpful.After reading a few reviews, I had high hopes for this item because it would be great to dump the chest strap, but it is not to be.It is my opinion, and has been my experience, that if one is serious about tracking their heart rate while performing any type of strenuous exercise, this is probably not the right tool.On the other hand, if one wants good sound without wires? This is the best I've found - but save the extra $50 and buy the non-Pulse version instead.","Reviewed in the United States December 20, 2016",AG6WWMARZJ7XGD55RII2YWNAPITA,True,12,Color: Power Red

Sound quality is brilliant - but I would suggest think carefully if you really need the pulse monitoring, work out exactly which app you will use it with, as I found the functionality much less than fitbit/suunto.

R37YQY18AANQLN,B01HETFPUE,1.0 out of 5 stars Accuracy of Heart Rate Monitor: Bose Pulse vs Chest Strap Heart Rate Monitor,slh22,1,"Updating my rating to 1 star. Used one time and now they won't turn on even though fully charged.Heart Rate vs Chest Strap Heart Rating Monitor: I compared the accuracy of these headphones against the accuracy of a heart rate chest strap (I was using the Wahoo Tickr) monitor. Here is what I found: during a 50 minute elliptical workout the heart rates either matched exactly or were one beat off (for example 161 vs 160). But at the end of the workout the average heart rates MATCHED EXACTLY. this gives me confidence that I'm getting an accurate read.I'm going with 4 starts as the volume tops out even when I woudl like to turn them up a bit higher.Also, I'm using the medium size tips and they are just not all that comfortable. I know I have them in vs just forgetting that I have headphones in","Reviewed in the United States March 17, 2018",AF54M3TYJE5Q4E6FEM5DHGBHKR4A,True,0,Color: Power Red

RLQV5ZW7XAPWA,B01HETFPUE,1.0 out of 5 stars Integration with RunKeeper is flawed,SAtkin,1,DOES NOT WORK WITH RUNKEEPER - despite what Bose implies. I purchased these headphones to be able to monitor my HR while tracking my runs with Runkeeper. After two runs - with no HR data being logged I contacted RunKeeper - and they indicated they do not support the Bose SoundSport Pulse headphones and have no plans to support those headphones. I then called Bose and they admitted that their internal technical documentation confirms that HR data is not captured/logged in RunKeeper (just displayed) although that documentation is not available to consumers. What is available to consumers indicates that the SoundSport Pulse is compatible with RunKeeper (I guess it's up to consumers to figure out what compatible means).Good luck with your purchase should you chose to continue with it...I'm returning mine. The actual headphones sound great. Just don't waste your money on the Pulse if you're using RunKeeper.,"Reviewed in the United States December 5, 2017",AERMKGCKWHG5LONRYPRFWLAE55GQ,True,1,Color: Power Red
R1MI3JS9SZKZDU,B01HETFPUE,2.0 out of 5 stars Pulse heart rate inaccurate,Amazon Customer,2,The sound quality and wearability is very good. The heart rate feature is definitely not worth the extra $50. I bought these so I could monitor my heart rate during exercise after I finished cardiac rehab for replacement of a congenital bicuspid aortic valve. I compared the heart rate reading from the accurate rehab monitor with the pulse. The correlation was so bad that the readings from the pulse were useless. I’m going to have to find a better heart monitor. Don’t waiste your money on the pulse.

I wear them to run in and while the sound is pretty decent, eventually you get tons of static in one or both ears, the pair just shuts off entirely, and/or they won't hold a charge.

That may be true in theory but the reality it it constantly missed my heart rate, just told me to insert into my ear because it was not detecting beat. But it was already in my ear canal, what was I supposed to do, drive it into my skull? I suppose Bose would prefer that as opposed to me returning but return I did. Thank God for Amazon's return policy on pricey products such as this that do not deliver. Oh and by the way, it was constantly dropping the Bluetooth connection to my iPhone 7 Plus.
