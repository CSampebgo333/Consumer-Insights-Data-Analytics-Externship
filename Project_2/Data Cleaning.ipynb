While searching for new earbuds, I had three things that I was looking for. If you aren't looking for what I was, which it can be 50/50, then you may be better off going with another option (Like Bose).Grip, Comfortability, and Ease of Use.In terms of Grip, I wanted a pair of earbuds that would stay on my ear. If I were to go for a run, work out, or play basketball I wanted earbuds that would rarely or never fall out. I had recently had a pair of the AirPods Pro, and they DID NOT workout for me, as they would fall out of my ear VERY EASILY. With the Beats Fit Pro, the little wing tip that goes on the inner part of your ear, aside from the actual earbud that goes inside of your ear, actually provides GREAT grip, and I've been able to do my workouts without these falling off. I also thing that since these earbuds DO NOT STICK OUT OF YOUR EAR as much as a BOSE or AirPods Pro do, that it adds more grip to stay on your ear.In terms of comfortability, this should be fairly straight forward. I've had cheap earbuds were after an hour or so of wearing them, your ear starts to get very sore. So much so, that it even hurt to take them off. So far, the Beat Fit Pro earbuds have been pretty good so far. I played around with the different size earbuds that they provide, and have found the size for me. I did noticed that, you have to play around with how they fit in your ear in order to get that \\\"perfect fit\\\" we are all looking for. When I first put them on, I had to rotation the earbud and play around with where the wing tip would go, before I found the spot that works for me. I just recently went on a 4 hour flight, and throughout the whole trip, my ear did not get sore.Regarding the Ease of Use, it was very simple to connect the Beats, and it is also very simple to change the settings from Noise Canceling, to Transparency, to turning both of those off if you wish. You do not need to download an app or anything, which is amazing for me as I hate the earbuds where you need to download an app and create an account, etc. I give this a 5/5.Now, there are things that are not the best when it comes to the Beats Fit Pro, that I think other earbuds will work better.Sound, and Noise Cancelation.I would give the sound a 3.5/5. It is not the loudest, doesn't have the best bass, and it's not the most profound. What I mean by profound, is those headphones in which you can hear every sound that goes into a certain beat. This is where I think, that if an amazing sound is all you care about, then going with a Bose might be better for you. At it's loudest volume, the Beats Fit Pro are really not that loud. I've had headphones were you can't stay on the loudest volume because it's simply just to loud. It's kind of the opposite with the Beats. The loudest they go, is about how I like them when I listen to music.Now, the Noise Cancelation on the Beats Fit Pro DOES WORK. I tried them in my house, and had some of my friends talk to me, and I really could not hear a word they were saying. I like that in the Beats Fit Pro, it is VERY EASY to turn the Noise Canceling feature off. HOWEVER, when in a relatively medium sounding environment, the Beats Fit Pro, won't fully block out all the sound. Even worse, if you are in a large sounding environment, you will 100% be able to hear everything going on. This most likely has to do with the lack of sound that I was explaining on the previous paragraph. I feel that if the sound was louder and more profound on the Beats, the Noise Cancelation would be much better.If you happen to read my long description, I hope this help!\",\n          \"I might just be crazy but I can use these things for like 10+ hours a day and I only need to charge them once a week or so. And on top of that, they can charge from dead to full in like an hour or so. I'm sure there are products with better sound quality and noise canceling but for the low price and insane battery life they're definitely better than most other products ive seen.They're comfortable and easily adjusted, my only complaint is that they're fairly tight so it can hurt your ears after a few hours but that's bound to happen with any headphones.Overall great product, I've used them every day since I bought them and never once regretted my purchase.\",\n          \"This was a gift and she loved them.

While searching for new earbuds, I had three things that I was looking for. If you aren't looking for what I was, which it can be 50/50, then you may be better off going with another option (Like Bose).Grip, Comfortability, and Ease of Use.In terms of Grip, I wanted a pair of earbuds that would stay on my ear. If I were to go for a run, work out, or play basketball I wanted earbuds that would rarely or never fall out. I had recently had a pair of the AirPods Pro, and they DID NOT workout for me, as they would fall out of my ear VERY EASILY. With the Beats Fit Pro, the little wing tip that goes on the inner part of your ear, aside from the actual earbud that goes inside of your ear, actually provides GREAT grip, and I've been able to do my workouts without these falling off. I also thing that since these earbuds DO NOT STICK OUT OF YOUR EAR as much as a BOSE or AirPods Pro do, that it adds more grip to stay on your ear.In terms of comfortability, this should be fairly straight forward. I've had cheap earbuds were after an hour or so of wearing them, your ear starts to get very sore. So much so, that it even hurt to take them off. So far, the Beat Fit Pro earbuds have been pretty good so far. I played around with the different size earbuds that they provide, and have found the size for me. I did noticed that, you have to play around with how they fit in your ear in order to get that \\\"perfect fit\\\" we are all looking for. When I first put them on, I had to rotation the earbud and play around with where the wing tip would go, before I found the spot that works for me. I just recently went on a 4 hour flight, and throughout the whole trip, my ear did not get sore.Regarding the Ease of Use, it was very simple to connect the Beats, and it is also very simple to change the settings from Noise Canceling, to Transparency, to turning both of those off if you wish. You do not need to download an app or anything, which is amazing for me as I hate the earbuds where you need to download an app and create an account, etc. I give this a 5/5.Now, there are things that are not the best when it comes to the Beats Fit Pro, that I think other earbuds will work better.Sound, and Noise Cancelation.I would give the sound a 3.5/5. It is not the loudest, doesn't have the best bass, and it's not the most profound. What I mean by profound, is those headphones in which you can hear every sound that goes into a certain beat. This is where I think, that if an amazing sound is all you care about, then going with a Bose might be better for you. At it's loudest volume, the Beats Fit Pro are really not that loud. I've had headphones were you can't stay on the loudest volume because it's simply just to loud. It's kind of the opposite with the Beats. The loudest they go, is about how I like them when I listen to music.Now, the Noise Cancelation on the Beats Fit Pro DOES WORK. I tried them in my house, and had some of my friends talk to me, and I really could not hear a word they were saying. I like that in the Beats Fit Pro, it is VERY EASY to turn the Noise Canceling feature off. HOWEVER, when in a relatively medium sounding environment, the Beats Fit Pro, won't fully block out all the sound. Even worse, if you are in a large sounding environment, you will 100% be able to hear everything going on. This most likely has to do with the lack of sound that I was explaining on the previous paragraph. I feel that if the sound was louder and more profound on the Beats, the Noise Cancelation would be much better.If you happen to read my long description, I hope this help!\",\n          \"I might just be crazy but I can use these things for like 10+ hours a day and I only need to charge them once a week or so. And on top of that, they can charge from dead to full in like an hour or so. I'm sure there are products with better sound quality and noise canceling but for the low price and insane battery life they're definitely better than most other products ive seen.They're comfortable and easily adjusted, my only complaint is that they're fairly tight so it can hurt your ears after a few hours but that's bound to happen with any headphones.Overall great product, I've used them every day since I bought them and never once regretted my purchase.\",\n          \"This was a gift and she loved them.
