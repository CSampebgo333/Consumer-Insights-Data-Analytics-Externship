The Perfect Budget Apple Watch",N/A,"This is the first time I am using an Apple Watch. After a lot of reviews and comparisons, I finally decided to go for the Apple Watch SE 2023 for:1) The crisp AMOLED display (Always on Display not available) - If you guys need the AOD, please skip this watch.2) Basic Features - As this is my first apple watch, I thought I need to get used to the UI and the gestures so I personally decided to go for the watch that has latest OS and processor with minimal and basic functions. (Blood Oxygen and ECG not available - if that is your priority, please skip this watch)3) Smooth Watch OS - This is by far the best UI I have ever used in a smart watch. Everything looks good, works good and feels good.4) Calling - The call quality in the watch is AMAZING! The user at the other end cannot tell the difference whether you're calling/communicating through your watch or through your phone.5) Accuracy - I heard many reviewers saying that the apple watch is the measuring stick for all tracking (sleep, step, heart rate, etc) and it is indeed true. All the measurements are almost 95% accurate when compared to the high-end measuring devices.Cons:I have been using this watch for the past 2 months and never really found any noticeable cons. If found any, definitely I will update.Overall it is an excellent product compared to other watches. Of course Samsung and Xiaomi offers better features such as AOD, Blood Oxygen Monitor, ECG, etc at a lesser price but still, considering the quality and user experience, definitely I would suggest this Apple Watch SE 2023.I purchased this watch for 25k which is surprising as 44mm SE 2023 at that price range was confusing as 40mm was around 27-28k at that time. I did not see any notable offers but surprisingly, I got this for a low price tag which also makes me adore the purchase I made.

My only concern is for the battery as It lasts only a day. Overall, It’s a beast on your wrist.

 You know it’ll be great when it’s apple. The Build Quality is Top-Notch. It comes with so many Cute watch-faces. I order a 40mm version so It fits well on my tiny wrist. The strap is really comfortable, It doesn’t leave a mark on your skin. Do charge it for 100% before using it for the first time. Mine was Drain when It arrived. My only concern is for the battery as It lasts only a day. Overall, It’s a beast on your wrist.

 You know it’ll be great when it’s apple. The Build Quality is Top-Notch. It comes with so many Cute watch-faces. I order a 40mm version so It fits well on my tiny wrist. The strap is really comfortable, It doesn’t leave a mark on your skin. Do charge it for 100% before using it for the first time. Mine was Drain when It arrived. My only concern is for the battery as It lasts only a day. Overall, It’s a beast on your wrist.

 You know it’ll be great when it’s apple. The Build Quality is Top-Notch. It comes with so many Cute watch-faces. I order a 40mm version so It fits well on my tiny wrist. The strap is really comfortable, It doesn’t leave a mark on your skin. Do charge it for 100% before using it for the first time. Mine was Drain when It arrived. My only concern is for the battery as It lasts only a day. Overall, It’s a beast on your wrist.

 You know it’ll be great when it’s apple. The Build Quality is Top-Notch. It comes with so many Cute watch-faces. I order a 40mm version so It fits well on my tiny wrist. The strap is really comfortable, It doesn’t leave a mark on your skin. Do charge it for 100% before using it for the first time. Mine was Drain when It arrived. My only concern is for the battery as It lasts only a day. Overall, It’s a beast on your wrist.

The Perfect Budget Apple Watch",N/A,"This is the first time I am using an Apple Watch. After a lot of reviews and comparisons, I finally decided to go for the Apple Watch SE 2023 for:1) The crisp AMOLED display (Always on Display not available) - If you guys need the AOD, please skip this watch.2) Basic Features - As this is my first apple watch, I thought I need to get used to the UI and the gestures so I personally decided to go for the watch that has latest OS and processor with minimal and basic functions. (Blood Oxygen and ECG not available - if that is your priority, please skip this watch)3) Smooth Watch OS - This is by far the best UI I have ever used in a smart watch. Everything looks good, works good and feels good.4) Calling - The call quality in the watch is AMAZING! The user at the other end cannot tell the difference whether you're calling/communicating through your watch or through your phone.5) Accuracy - I heard many reviewers saying that the apple watch is the measuring stick for all tracking (sleep, step, heart rate, etc) and it is indeed true. All the measurements are almost 95% accurate when compared to the high-end measuring devices.Cons:I have been using this watch for the past 2 months and never really found any noticeable cons. If found any, definitely I will update.Overall it is an excellent product compared to other watches. Of course Samsung and Xiaomi offers better features such as AOD, Blood Oxygen Monitor, ECG, etc at a lesser price but still, considering the quality and user experience, definitely I would suggest this Apple Watch SE 2023.I purchased this watch for 25k which is surprising as 44mm SE 2023 at that price range was confusing as 40mm was around 27-28k at that time. I did not see any notable offers but surprisingly, I got this for a low price tag which also makes me adore the purchase I made.

The Perfect Budget Apple Watch",N/A,"This is the first time I am using an Apple Watch. After a lot of reviews and comparisons, I finally decided to go for the Apple Watch SE 2023 for:1) The crisp AMOLED display (Always on Display not available) - If you guys need the AOD, please skip this watch.2) Basic Features - As this is my first apple watch, I thought I need to get used to the UI and the gestures so I personally decided to go for the watch that has latest OS and processor with minimal and basic functions. (Blood Oxygen and ECG not available - if that is your priority, please skip this watch)3) Smooth Watch OS - This is by far the best UI I have ever used in a smart watch. Everything looks good, works good and feels good.4) Calling - The call quality in the watch is AMAZING! The user at the other end cannot tell the difference whether you're calling/communicating through your watch or through your phone.5) Accuracy - I heard many reviewers saying that the apple watch is the measuring stick for all tracking (sleep, step, heart rate, etc) and it is indeed true. All the measurements are almost 95% accurate when compared to the high-end measuring devices.Cons:I have been using this watch for the past 2 months and never really found any noticeable cons. If found any, definitely I will update.Overall it is an excellent product compared to other watches. Of course Samsung and Xiaomi offers better features such as AOD, Blood Oxygen Monitor, ECG, etc at a lesser price but still, considering the quality and user experience, definitely I would suggest this Apple Watch SE 2023.I purchased this watch for 25k which is surprising as 44mm SE 2023 at that price range was confusing as 40mm was around 27-28k at that time. I did not see any notable offers but surprisingly, I got this for a low price tag which also makes me adore the purchase I made.

Best product from Apple",N/A,"The Apple Watch Series 8 is the latest iteration of the popular smartwatch that offers a range of features for health, fitness, communication and entertainment. The watch has a sleek design, a bright and responsive display, and a variety of sensors and apps that can monitor your heart rate, blood oxygen, sleep quality, activity levels and more. The watch also supports wireless charging, cellular connectivity, Siri voice assistant, Apple Pay and other useful functions.However, the watch is not without its drawbacks. One of the main issues is the battery life, which is not very impressive compared to some of the competitors. The watch can last for about 18 hours on a single charge, which means you have to charge it every night or carry a charger with you during the day. This can be inconvenient if you want to use the watch for longer periods of time or track your sleep patterns. The battery life can also vary depending on how you use the watch and what settings you choose.The watch is compatible only with iPhones, so if you have an Android phone or another device, you will not be able to use it.Overall, the Apple Watch Series 8 is a great device for Apple fans and users who want a versatile and advanced smartwatch that can do many things. The battery life and the price are two of the main factors that you should consider before buying this watch.

The watch has a sleek design, a bright and responsive display, and a variety of sensors and apps that can monitor your heart rate, blood oxygen, sleep quality, activity levels and more. The watch also supports wireless charging, cellular connectivity, Siri voice assistant, Apple Pay and other useful functions.However, the watch is not without its drawbacks. One of the main issues is the battery life, which is not very impressive compared to some of the competitors.

This can be inconvenient if you want to use the watch for longer periods of time or track your sleep patterns. The battery life can also vary depending on how you use the watch and what settings you choose.The watch is compatible only with iPhones, so if you have an Android phone or another device, you will not be able to use it.Overall, the Apple Watch Series 8 is a great device for Apple fans and users who want a versatile and advanced smartwatch that can do many things.

One of the main issues is the battery life, which is not very impressive compared to some of the competitors.

This can be inconvenient if you want to use the watch for longer periods of time or track your sleep patterns. The battery life can also vary depending on how you use the watch and what settings you choose.The watch is compatible only with iPhones, so if you have an Android phone or another device, you will not be able to use it.Overall, the Apple Watch Series 8 is a great device for Apple fans and users who want a versatile and advanced smartwatch that can do many things.

This can be inconvenient if you want to use the watch for longer periods of time or track your sleep patterns. The battery life can also vary depending on how you use the watch and what settings you choose.The watch is compatible only with iPhones, so if you have an Android phone or another device, you will not be able to use it.Overall, the Apple Watch Series 8 is a great device for Apple fans and users who want a versatile and advanced smartwatch that can do many things.

Inspire 2 does most of things that it's supposed to do.",N/A,"Inspire 2 fits well, feels light on the hand with quality band. The free one year fitbit premium is a bonus but haven't explored it much in the first one month. Below are the few key details of the inspire 2 functionalities.1. Excellent battery life as claimed for a normal 24*7 usage.2. Tends to slightly over count the steps which is a common aspect with all fitbit devices.3. Accurate sleep and heart rate monitoring.4. Faced issues while initiating the premium free trail. Instead of starting the free trail, it directly charged me for one month subscription but upon reporting the issue to support team, they promptly resolved the issue and even refunded the amount that was charged for the one month subscription.5. Engaging health insights.6. Notifications functionality isn't working properly. With same settings, sometimes it shows the notifications and sometimes it doesn't but it isn't a deal breaker for me.7. Finally, the extremely short charging cable is utterly disappointing when one considers the price that's been paid. The length of the charger is  about 10-15 cms and one will great difficulties in finding an appropriate charging spot unless it's connected to a laptop.8. Haven't explored much of the activities tracking except for walking.All in all, inspire 2 does most of things that it's supposed to do.

Works Perfectly, great battery",N/A,"This Fitbit Inspire 2 has actually inspired me to do my 10, 000 steps a day, and it's fun seeing your progress and active minutes in tangible, measurable data. It's also the most comfortable band I've ever worn- very soft, and even though it's all plastic, it's solid, high quality plastic. Band fits securely even on my skinny wrists. The app is OK; could be more intuitive, but you get used to it. It's nice being able to see my resting heart rate go down with regular exercise, and the menstrual cycle tracker is useful too- has accurately warned me a couple days before I start my period. Battery life is EXCELLENT; much better than my old Charge 2. Lasts 7-10 days easily if you don't work out every single day. It actually IS water and sweat resistant as it claims, doesn't get as sticky or uncomfortable as some other smart watches or fitness trackers.There are a couple of things I don't like: the charger is proprietary, which means one more adapter and cable to pack instead of the widely used USB Type C. Also the squeeze to toggle modes function often activates when I bend my wrist backwards. I imagine this would be a dealbreaker if I did a lot of yoga, but even if you're playing racquet sports and wearing this on your non dominant hand, this shouldn't be an issue.Apart from that, I really can't think of any downsides. Would recommend for people who want to maintain or build a good level of fitness and don't want to charge their device too often.

This band will charge only if remaining battery life is 5% or 0.It used to take me day or 2 to get charging started once it was at 5% or less.When I raised this issue with Fitbit support they acknowledged & sent a replacement from Hong Kong as they have no service center in India.The replacement band has extremely dim light & its unuseable, I tried to change dim light settings to no avail.

"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Steve McBride,N/A,My Inspire 2 is pretty accurate - and when it is not - it is amusing,N/A,"I bought my Inspire 2 a couple months ago, and I just love it!What I use it for is as a heart rate monitor and to track my sleep.  It has a really long battery life - I recharge it about every 10 days (it sends me an email to remind me when it needs charging).  It is also really lightweight.My normal forms of exercise are: weights, treadmill, walks (our neighborhood is quite hilly), and yoga.  My fitbit does really well at tracking my heart rate on walks - and it leverages my phone's GPS for distance.  It sometimes does well at tracking intensity on the treadmill, and sometimes not.  How tightly you wear the watchband affects if it misses beats.  An amusing aspect of the heart rate monitor is - that something about going shopping at Costco with my wife sometimes causes my heart rate to go up quite a bit.  I think it is we naturally shop at different speeds.  I try to fob the increase in heart rate off as the romance of shopping together, but my wife is not buying it...  The fitbit will report those bouts of high heart rate as exercise.  Normally, though, the heart rate is pretty accurate - I was in the hospital for a little while - and one of the things I liked to do was compare my fitbit's heart rate measure - with that of the hospital's heart rate monitor.  In general they were within 1 beat of each other.  I use the Active Zone Minutes feature of fitbit to help me track my 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week.  Active Zone Minutes can be more or less accurate, so I don't follow them religiously, but more as a motivator to do more.As a sleep tracker my fitbit is also very useful.  I am trying to get more sleep -- and having an objective source of data gives me feedback on how I am doing .  I have noticed though, if you sit really still for a long period of time, such as in an emergency room, it interprets that as sleep.  I suppose sitting quietly is a form of rest, so I don't feel too bad about that.I find my fitbit very motivating -- it causes me to do more exercise than I would have otherwise.  I think the mind set that it promotes is very helpful.  It makes a great watch.  For the most part it is unobtrusive.  If you already have a smart-phone, and want to improve your health, the Inspire 2 is reasonably priced for what it gives.  So far I have not used the Premium features that much - so I don't have an opinion on that at this point.Cronometer (a nutrition tracking app - that can also be used to track biometrics) can be linked to my fitbit, and automatically grab some metrics - I find that very useful too.  Fitbit is mostly focused on exercise - I find it easier to use Cronometer to track food, blood pressure, blood glucose, weight etc...I did also try the fitbit smart scale but it did not work well for me, so I manually enter weight data into my fitbit app.The Inspire 2 is definitely a keeper and, for me, well worth the money.

Works Perfectly, great battery",N/A,"This Fitbit Inspire 2 has actually inspired me to do my 10, 000 steps a day, and it's fun seeing your progress and active minutes in tangible, measurable data. It's also the most comfortable band I've ever worn- very soft, and even though it's all plastic, it's solid, high quality plastic. Band fits securely even on my skinny wrists. The app is OK; could be more intuitive, but you get used to it. It's nice being able to see my resting heart rate go down with regular exercise, and the menstrual cycle tracker is useful too- has accurately warned me a couple days before I start my period. Battery life is EXCELLENT; much better than my old Charge 2. Lasts 7-10 days easily if you don't work out every single day. It actually IS water and sweat resistant as it claims, doesn't get as sticky or uncomfortable as some other smart watches or fitness trackers.There are a couple of things I don't like: the charger is proprietary, which means one more adapter and cable to pack instead of the widely used USB Type C. Also the squeeze to toggle modes function often activates when I bend my wrist backwards. I imagine this would be a dealbreaker if I did a lot of yoga, but even if you're playing racquet sports and wearing this on your non dominant hand, this shouldn't be an issue.Apart from that, I really can't think of any downsides. Would recommend for people who want to maintain or build a good level of fitness and don't want to charge their device too often.

This band will charge only if remaining battery life is 5% or 0.It used to take me day or 2 to get charging started once it was at 5% or less.When I raised this issue with Fitbit support they acknowledged & sent a replacement from Hong Kong as they have no service center in India.The replacement band has extremely dim light & its unuseable, I tried to change dim light settings to no avail.

"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Steve McBride,N/A,My Inspire 2 is pretty accurate - and when it is not - it is amusing,N/A,"I bought my Inspire 2 a couple months ago, and I just love it!What I use it for is as a heart rate monitor and to track my sleep.  It has a really long battery life - I recharge it about every 10 days (it sends me an email to remind me when it needs charging).  It is also really lightweight.My normal forms of exercise are: weights, treadmill, walks (our neighborhood is quite hilly), and yoga.  My fitbit does really well at tracking my heart rate on walks - and it leverages my phone's GPS for distance.  It sometimes does well at tracking intensity on the treadmill, and sometimes not.  How tightly you wear the watchband affects if it misses beats.  An amusing aspect of the heart rate monitor is - that something about going shopping at Costco with my wife sometimes causes my heart rate to go up quite a bit.  I think it is we naturally shop at different speeds.  I try to fob the increase in heart rate off as the romance of shopping together, but my wife is not buying it...  The fitbit will report those bouts of high heart rate as exercise.  Normally, though, the heart rate is pretty accurate - I was in the hospital for a little while - and one of the things I liked to do was compare my fitbit's heart rate measure - with that of the hospital's heart rate monitor.  In general they were within 1 beat of each other.  I use the Active Zone Minutes feature of fitbit to help me track my 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week.  Active Zone Minutes can be more or less accurate, so I don't follow them religiously, but more as a motivator to do more.As a sleep tracker my fitbit is also very useful.  I am trying to get more sleep -- and having an objective source of data gives me feedback on how I am doing .  I have noticed though, if you sit really still for a long period of time, such as in an emergency room, it interprets that as sleep.  I suppose sitting quietly is a form of rest, so I don't feel too bad about that.I find my fitbit very motivating -- it causes me to do more exercise than I would have otherwise.  I think the mind set that it promotes is very helpful.  It makes a great watch.  For the most part it is unobtrusive.  If you already have a smart-phone, and want to improve your health, the Inspire 2 is reasonably priced for what it gives.  So far I have not used the Premium features that much - so I don't have an opinion on that at this point.Cronometer (a nutrition tracking app - that can also be used to track biometrics) can be linked to my fitbit, and automatically grab some metrics - I find that very useful too.  Fitbit is mostly focused on exercise - I find it easier to use Cronometer to track food, blood pressure, blood glucose, weight etc...I did also try the fitbit smart scale but it did not work well for me, so I manually enter weight data into my fitbit app.The Inspire 2 is definitely a keeper and, for me, well worth the money.

Works Perfectly, great battery",N/A,"This Fitbit Inspire 2 has actually inspired me to do my 10, 000 steps a day, and it's fun seeing your progress and active minutes in tangible, measurable data. It's also the most comfortable band I've ever worn- very soft, and even though it's all plastic, it's solid, high quality plastic. Band fits securely even on my skinny wrists. The app is OK; could be more intuitive, but you get used to it. It's nice being able to see my resting heart rate go down with regular exercise, and the menstrual cycle tracker is useful too- has accurately warned me a couple days before I start my period. Battery life is EXCELLENT; much better than my old Charge 2. Lasts 7-10 days easily if you don't work out every single day. It actually IS water and sweat resistant as it claims, doesn't get as sticky or uncomfortable as some other smart watches or fitness trackers.There are a couple of things I don't like: the charger is proprietary, which means one more adapter and cable to pack instead of the widely used USB Type C. Also the squeeze to toggle modes function often activates when I bend my wrist backwards. I imagine this would be a dealbreaker if I did a lot of yoga, but even if you're playing racquet sports and wearing this on your non dominant hand, this shouldn't be an issue.Apart from that, I really can't think of any downsides. Would recommend for people who want to maintain or build a good level of fitness and don't want to charge their device too often.

Would recommend for people who want to maintain or build a good level of fitness and don't want to charge their device too often.

This band will charge only if remaining battery life is 5% or 0.It used to take me day or 2 to get charging started once it was at 5% or less.When I raised this issue with Fitbit support they acknowledged & sent a replacement from Hong Kong as they have no service center in India.The replacement band has extremely dim light & its unuseable, I tried to change dim light settings to no avail.

"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Steve McBride,N/A,My Inspire 2 is pretty accurate - and when it is not - it is amusing,N/A,"I bought my Inspire 2 a couple months ago, and I just love it!What I use it for is as a heart rate monitor and to track my sleep.  It has a really long battery life - I recharge it about every 10 days (it sends me an email to remind me when it needs charging).  It is also really lightweight.My normal forms of exercise are: weights, treadmill, walks (our neighborhood is quite hilly), and yoga.  My fitbit does really well at tracking my heart rate on walks - and it leverages my phone's GPS for distance.  It sometimes does well at tracking intensity on the treadmill, and sometimes not.  How tightly you wear the watchband affects if it misses beats.  An amusing aspect of the heart rate monitor is - that something about going shopping at Costco with my wife sometimes causes my heart rate to go up quite a bit.  I think it is we naturally shop at different speeds.  I try to fob the increase in heart rate off as the romance of shopping together, but my wife is not buying it...  The fitbit will report those bouts of high heart rate as exercise.  Normally, though, the heart rate is pretty accurate - I was in the hospital for a little while - and one of the things I liked to do was compare my fitbit's heart rate measure - with that of the hospital's heart rate monitor.  In general they were within 1 beat of each other.  I use the Active Zone Minutes feature of fitbit to help me track my 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week.  Active Zone Minutes can be more or less accurate, so I don't follow them religiously, but more as a motivator to do more.As a sleep tracker my fitbit is also very useful.  I am trying to get more sleep -- and having an objective source of data gives me feedback on how I am doing .  I have noticed though, if you sit really still for a long period of time, such as in an emergency room, it interprets that as sleep.  I suppose sitting quietly is a form of rest, so I don't feel too bad about that.I find my fitbit very motivating -- it causes me to do more exercise than I would have otherwise.  I think the mind set that it promotes is very helpful.  It makes a great watch.  For the most part it is unobtrusive.  If you already have a smart-phone, and want to improve your health, the Inspire 2 is reasonably priced for what it gives.  So far I have not used the Premium features that much - so I don't have an opinion on that at this point.Cronometer (a nutrition tracking app - that can also be used to track biometrics) can be linked to my fitbit, and automatically grab some metrics - I find that very useful too.  Fitbit is mostly focused on exercise - I find it easier to use Cronometer to track food, blood pressure, blood glucose, weight etc...I did also try the fitbit smart scale but it did not work well for me, so I manually enter weight data into my fitbit app.The Inspire 2 is definitely a keeper and, for me, well worth the money.

Works Perfectly, great battery",N/A,"This Fitbit Inspire 2 has actually inspired me to do my 10, 000 steps a day, and it's fun seeing your progress and active minutes in tangible, measurable data. It's also the most comfortable band I've ever worn- very soft, and even though it's all plastic, it's solid, high quality plastic. Band fits securely even on my skinny wrists. The app is OK; could be more intuitive, but you get used to it. It's nice being able to see my resting heart rate go down with regular exercise, and the menstrual cycle tracker is useful too- has accurately warned me a couple days before I start my period. Battery life is EXCELLENT; much better than my old Charge 2. Lasts 7-10 days easily if you don't work out every single day. It actually IS water and sweat resistant as it claims, doesn't get as sticky or uncomfortable as some other smart watches or fitness trackers.There are a couple of things I don't like: the charger is proprietary, which means one more adapter and cable to pack instead of the widely used USB Type C. Also the squeeze to toggle modes function often activates when I bend my wrist backwards. I imagine this would be a dealbreaker if I did a lot of yoga, but even if you're playing racquet sports and wearing this on your non dominant hand, this shouldn't be an issue.Apart from that, I really can't think of any downsides.

It actually IS water and sweat resistant as it claims, doesn't get as sticky or uncomfortable as some other smart watches or fitness trackers.There are a couple of things I don't like: the charger is proprietary, which means one more adapter and cable to pack instead of the widely used USB Type C. Also the squeeze to toggle modes function often activates when I bend my wrist backwards. I imagine this would be a dealbreaker if I did a lot of yoga, but even if you're playing racquet sports and wearing this on your non dominant hand, this shouldn't be an issue.Apart from that, I really can't think of any downsides. Would recommend for people who want to maintain or build a good level of fitness and don't want to charge their device too often.

Poor battery, no service center in India",N/A,"I purchased Inspire 2 from Amazon in India. After 5 months I started facing issues with charging it. This band will charge only if remaining battery life is 5% or 0.It used to take me day or 2 to get charging started once it was at 5% or less.When I raised this issue with Fitbit support they acknowledged & sent a replacement from Hong Kong as they have no service center in India.The replacement band has extremely dim light & its unuseable, I tried to change dim light settings to no avail.

"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Steve McBride,N/A,My Inspire 2 is pretty accurate - and when it is not - it is amusing,N/A,"I bought my Inspire 2 a couple months ago, and I just love it!What I use it for is as a heart rate monitor and to track my sleep.  It has a really long battery life - I recharge it about every 10 days (it sends me an email to remind me when it needs charging).  It is also really lightweight.My normal forms of exercise are: weights, treadmill, walks (our neighborhood is quite hilly), and yoga.  My fitbit does really well at tracking my heart rate on walks - and it leverages my phone's GPS for distance.  It sometimes does well at tracking intensity on the treadmill, and sometimes not.  How tightly you wear the watchband affects if it misses beats.  An amusing aspect of the heart rate monitor is - that something about going shopping at Costco with my wife sometimes causes my heart rate to go up quite a bit.  I think it is we naturally shop at different speeds.  I try to fob the increase in heart rate off as the romance of shopping together, but my wife is not buying it...  The fitbit will report those bouts of high heart rate as exercise.  Normally, though, the heart rate is pretty accurate - I was in the hospital for a little while - and one of the things I liked to do was compare my fitbit's heart rate measure - with that of the hospital's heart rate monitor.  In general they were within 1 beat of each other.  I use the Active Zone Minutes feature of fitbit to help me track my 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week.  Active Zone Minutes can be more or less accurate, so I don't follow them religiously, but more as a motivator to do more.As a sleep tracker my fitbit is also very useful.  I am trying to get more sleep -- and having an objective source of data gives me feedback on how I am doing .  I have noticed though, if you sit really still for a long period of time, such as in an emergency room, it interprets that as sleep.  I suppose sitting quietly is a form of rest, so I don't feel too bad about that.I find my fitbit very motivating -- it causes me to do more exercise than I would have otherwise.  I think the mind set that it promotes is very helpful.  It makes a great watch.  For the most part it is unobtrusive.  If you already have a smart-phone, and want to improve your health, the Inspire 2 is reasonably priced for what it gives.  So far I have not used the Premium features that much - so I don't have an opinion on that at this point.Cronometer (a nutrition tracking app - that can also be used to track biometrics) can be linked to my fitbit, and automatically grab some metrics - I find that very useful too.  Fitbit is mostly focused on exercise - I find it easier to use Cronometer to track food, blood pressure, blood glucose, weight etc...I did also try the fitbit smart scale but it did not work well for me, so I manually enter weight data into my fitbit app.The Inspire 2 is definitely a keeper and, for me, well worth the money.

It's also the most comfortable band I've ever worn- very soft, and even though it's all plastic, it's solid, high quality plastic. Band fits securely even on my skinny wrists. The app is OK; could be more intuitive, but you get used to it. It's nice being able to see my resting heart rate go down with regular exercise, and the menstrual cycle tracker is useful too- has accurately warned me a couple days before I start my period. Battery life is EXCELLENT; much better than my old Charge 2. Lasts 7-10 days easily if you don't work out every single day. It actually IS water and sweat resistant as it claims, doesn't get as sticky or uncomfortable as some other smart watches or fitness trackers.There are a couple of things I don't like: the charger is proprietary, which means one more adapter and cable to pack instead of the widely used USB Type C. Also the squeeze to toggle modes function often activates when I bend my wrist backwards. I imagine this would be a dealbreaker if I did a lot of yoga, but even if you're playing racquet sports and wearing this on your non dominant hand, this shouldn't be an issue.Apart from that, I really can't think of any downsides. Would recommend for people who want to maintain or build a good level of fitness and don't want to charge their device too often.

Poor battery, no service center in India",N/A,"I purchased Inspire 2 from Amazon in India. After 5 months I started facing issues with charging it. This band will charge only if remaining battery life is 5% or 0.It used to take me day or 2 to get charging started once it was at 5% or less.When I raised this issue with Fitbit support they acknowledged & sent a replacement from Hong Kong as they have no service center in India.The replacement band has extremely dim light & its unuseable, I tried to change dim light settings to no avail. Both bands are useless now.

"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Steve McBride,N/A,My Inspire 2 is pretty accurate - and when it is not - it is amusing,N/A,"I bought my Inspire 2 a couple months ago, and I just love it!What I use it for is as a heart rate monitor and to track my sleep.  It has a really long battery life - I recharge it about every 10 days (it sends me an email to remind me when it needs charging).  It is also really lightweight.My normal forms of exercise are: weights, treadmill, walks (our neighborhood is quite hilly), and yoga.  My fitbit does really well at tracking my heart rate on walks - and it leverages my phone's GPS for distance.  It sometimes does well at tracking intensity on the treadmill, and sometimes not.  How tightly you wear the watchband affects if it misses beats.  An amusing aspect of the heart rate monitor is - that something about going shopping at Costco with my wife sometimes causes my heart rate to go up quite a bit.  I think it is we naturally shop at different speeds.  I try to fob the increase in heart rate off as the romance of shopping together, but my wife is not buying it...  The fitbit will report those bouts of high heart rate as exercise.  Normally, though, the heart rate is pretty accurate - I was in the hospital for a little while - and one of the things I liked to do was compare my fitbit's heart rate measure - with that of the hospital's heart rate monitor.  In general they were within 1 beat of each other.  I use the Active Zone Minutes feature of fitbit to help me track my 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week.  Active Zone Minutes can be more or less accurate, so I don't follow them religiously, but more as a motivator to do more.As a sleep tracker my fitbit is also very useful.  I am trying to get more sleep -- and having an objective source of data gives me feedback on how I am doing .  I have noticed though, if you sit really still for a long period of time, such as in an emergency room, it interprets that as sleep.  I suppose sitting quietly is a form of rest, so I don't feel too bad about that.I find my fitbit very motivating -- it causes me to do more exercise than I would have otherwise.  I think the mind set that it promotes is very helpful.  It makes a great watch.  For the most part it is unobtrusive.  If you already have a smart-phone, and want to improve your health, the Inspire 2 is reasonably priced for what it gives.  So far I have not used the Premium features that much - so I don't have an opinion on that at this point.Cronometer (a nutrition tracking app - that can also be used to track biometrics) can be linked to my fitbit, and automatically grab some metrics - I find that very useful too.  Fitbit is mostly focused on exercise - I find it easier to use Cronometer to track food, blood pressure, blood glucose, weight etc...I did also try the fitbit smart scale but it did not work well for me, so I manually enter weight data into my fitbit app.The Inspire 2 is definitely a keeper and, for me, well worth the money.

Works Perfectly, great battery",N/A,"This Fitbit Inspire 2 has actually inspired me to do my 10, 000 steps a day, and it's fun seeing your progress and active minutes in tangible, measurable data. It's also the most comfortable band I've ever worn- very soft, and even though it's all plastic, it's solid, high quality plastic. Band fits securely even on my skinny wrists. The app is OK; could be more intuitive, but you get used to it. It's nice being able to see my resting heart rate go down with regular exercise, and the menstrual cycle tracker is useful too- has accurately warned me a couple days before I start my period. Battery life is EXCELLENT; much better than my old Charge 2. Lasts 7-10 days easily if you don't work out every single day. It actually IS water and sweat resistant as it claims, doesn't get as sticky or uncomfortable as some other smart watches or fitness trackers.There are a couple of things I don't like: the charger is proprietary, which means one more adapter and cable to pack instead of the widely used USB Type C. Also the squeeze to toggle modes function often activates when I bend my wrist backwards. I imagine this would be a dealbreaker if I did a lot of yoga, but even if you're playing racquet sports and wearing this on your non dominant hand, this shouldn't be an issue.Apart from that, I really can't think of any downsides. Would recommend for people who want to maintain or build a good level of fitness and don't want to charge their device too often.

Poor battery, no service center in India",N/A,"I purchased Inspire 2 from Amazon in India. After 5 months I started facing issues with charging it. This band will charge only if remaining battery life is 5% or 0.It used to take me day or 2 to get charging started once it was at 5% or less.When I raised this issue with Fitbit support they acknowledged & sent a replacement from Hong Kong as they have no service center in India.The replacement band has extremely dim light & its unuseable, I tried to change dim light settings to no avail. Both bands are useless now.

"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Steve McBride,N/A,My Inspire 2 is pretty accurate - and when it is not - it is amusing,N/A,"I bought my Inspire 2 a couple months ago, and I just love it!What I use it for is as a heart rate monitor and to track my sleep.  It has a really long battery life - I recharge it about every 10 days (it sends me an email to remind me when it needs charging).  It is also really lightweight.My normal forms of exercise are: weights, treadmill, walks (our neighborhood is quite hilly), and yoga.  My fitbit does really well at tracking my heart rate on walks - and it leverages my phone's GPS for distance.  It sometimes does well at tracking intensity on the treadmill, and sometimes not.  How tightly you wear the watchband affects if it misses beats.  An amusing aspect of the heart rate monitor is - that something about going shopping at Costco with my wife sometimes causes my heart rate to go up quite a bit.  I think it is we naturally shop at different speeds.  I try to fob the increase in heart rate off as the romance of shopping together, but my wife is not buying it...  The fitbit will report those bouts of high heart rate as exercise.  Normally, though, the heart rate is pretty accurate - I was in the hospital for a little while - and one of the things I liked to do was compare my fitbit's heart rate measure - with that of the hospital's heart rate monitor.  In general they were within 1 beat of each other.  I use the Active Zone Minutes feature of fitbit to help me track my 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week.  Active Zone Minutes can be more or less accurate, so I don't follow them religiously, but more as a motivator to do more.As a sleep tracker my fitbit is also very useful.  I am trying to get more sleep -- and having an objective source of data gives me feedback on how I am doing .  I have noticed though, if you sit really still for a long period of time, such as in an emergency room, it interprets that as sleep.  I suppose sitting quietly is a form of rest, so I don't feel too bad about that.I find my fitbit very motivating -- it causes me to do more exercise than I would have otherwise.  I think the mind set that it promotes is very helpful.  It makes a great watch.  For the most part it is unobtrusive.  If you already have a smart-phone, and want to improve your health, the Inspire 2 is reasonably priced for what it gives.  So far I have not used the Premium features that much - so I don't have an opinion on that at this point.Cronometer (a nutrition tracking app - that can also be used to track biometrics) can be linked to my fitbit, and automatically grab some metrics - I find that very useful too.  Fitbit is mostly focused on exercise - I find it easier to use Cronometer to track food, blood pressure, blood glucose, weight etc...I did also try the fitbit smart scale but it did not work well for me, so I manually enter weight data into my fitbit app.The Inspire 2 is definitely a keeper and, for me, well worth the money.

Works Perfectly, great battery",N/A,"This Fitbit Inspire 2 has actually inspired me to do my 10, 000 steps a day, and it's fun seeing your progress and active minutes in tangible, measurable data. It's also the most comfortable band I've ever worn- very soft, and even though it's all plastic, it's solid, high quality plastic. Band fits securely even on my skinny wrists. The app is OK; could be more intuitive, but you get used to it. It's nice being able to see my resting heart rate go down with regular exercise, and the menstrual cycle tracker is useful too- has accurately warned me a couple days before I start my period. Battery life is EXCELLENT; much better than my old Charge 2. Lasts 7-10 days easily if you don't work out every single day. It actually IS water and sweat resistant as it claims, doesn't get as sticky or uncomfortable as some other smart watches or fitness trackers.There are a couple of things I don't like: the charger is proprietary, which means one more adapter and cable to pack instead of the widely used USB Type C. Also the squeeze to toggle modes function often activates when I bend my wrist backwards. I imagine this would be a dealbreaker if I did a lot of yoga, but even if you're playing racquet sports and wearing this on your non dominant hand, this shouldn't be an issue.Apart from that, I really can't think of any downsides. Would recommend for people who want to maintain or build a good level of fitness and don't want to charge their device too often.

Poor battery, no service center in India",N/A,"I purchased Inspire 2 from Amazon in India. After 5 months I started facing issues with charging it. This band will charge only if remaining battery life is 5% or 0.It used to take me day or 2 to get charging started once it was at 5% or less.When I raised this issue with Fitbit support they acknowledged & sent a replacement from Hong Kong as they have no service center in India.The replacement band has extremely dim light & its unuseable, I tried to change dim light settings to no avail. Both bands are useless now.

"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Steve McBride,N/A,My Inspire 2 is pretty accurate - and when it is not - it is amusing,N/A,"I bought my Inspire 2 a couple months ago, and I just love it!What I use it for is as a heart rate monitor and to track my sleep.  It has a really long battery life - I recharge it about every 10 days (it sends me an email to remind me when it needs charging).  It is also really lightweight.My normal forms of exercise are: weights, treadmill, walks (our neighborhood is quite hilly), and yoga.  My fitbit does really well at tracking my heart rate on walks - and it leverages my phone's GPS for distance.  It sometimes does well at tracking intensity on the treadmill, and sometimes not.  How tightly you wear the watchband affects if it misses beats.  An amusing aspect of the heart rate monitor is - that something about going shopping at Costco with my wife sometimes causes my heart rate to go up quite a bit.  I think it is we naturally shop at different speeds.  I try to fob the increase in heart rate off as the romance of shopping together, but my wife is not buying it...  The fitbit will report those bouts of high heart rate as exercise.  Normally, though, the heart rate is pretty accurate - I was in the hospital for a little while - and one of the things I liked to do was compare my fitbit's heart rate measure - with that of the hospital's heart rate monitor.  In general they were within 1 beat of each other.  I use the Active Zone Minutes feature of fitbit to help me track my 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week.  Active Zone Minutes can be more or less accurate, so I don't follow them religiously, but more as a motivator to do more.As a sleep tracker my fitbit is also very useful.  I am trying to get more sleep -- and having an objective source of data gives me feedback on how I am doing .  I have noticed though, if you sit really still for a long period of time, such as in an emergency room, it interprets that as sleep.  I suppose sitting quietly is a form of rest, so I don't feel too bad about that.I find my fitbit very motivating -- it causes me to do more exercise than I would have otherwise.  I think the mind set that it promotes is very helpful.  It makes a great watch.  For the most part it is unobtrusive.  If you already have a smart-phone, and want to improve your health, the Inspire 2 is reasonably priced for what it gives.  So far I have not used the Premium features that much - so I don't have an opinion on that at this point.Cronometer (a nutrition tracking app - that can also be used to track biometrics) can be linked to my fitbit, and automatically grab some metrics - I find that very useful too.  Fitbit is mostly focused on exercise - I find it easier to use Cronometer to track food, blood pressure, blood glucose, weight etc...I did also try the fitbit smart scale but it did not work well for me, so I manually enter weight data into my fitbit app.The Inspire 2 is definitely a keeper and, for me, well worth the money.

Works Perfectly, great battery",N/A,"This Fitbit Inspire 2 has actually inspired me to do my 10, 000 steps a day, and it's fun seeing your progress and active minutes in tangible, measurable data. It's also the most comfortable band I've ever worn- very soft, and even though it's all plastic, it's solid, high quality plastic. Band fits securely even on my skinny wrists. The app is OK; could be more intuitive, but you get used to it. It's nice being able to see my resting heart rate go down with regular exercise, and the menstrual cycle tracker is useful too- has accurately warned me a couple days before I start my period. Battery life is EXCELLENT; much better than my old Charge 2. Lasts 7-10 days easily if you don't work out every single day. It actually IS water and sweat resistant as it claims, doesn't get as sticky or uncomfortable as some other smart watches or fitness trackers.There are a couple of things I don't like: the charger is proprietary, which means one more adapter and cable to pack instead of the widely used USB Type C. Also the squeeze to toggle modes function often activates when I bend my wrist backwards. I imagine this would be a dealbreaker if I did a lot of yoga, but even if you're playing racquet sports and wearing this on your non dominant hand, this shouldn't be an issue.Apart from that, I really can't think of any downsides. Would recommend for people who want to maintain or build a good level of fitness and don't want to charge their device too often.

Poor battery, no service center in India",N/A,"I purchased Inspire 2 from Amazon in India. After 5 months I started facing issues with charging it. This band will charge only if remaining battery life is 5% or 0.It used to take me day or 2 to get charging started once it was at 5% or less.When I raised this issue with Fitbit support they acknowledged & sent a replacement from Hong Kong as they have no service center in India.The replacement band has extremely dim light & its unuseable, I tried to change dim light settings to no avail. Both bands are useless now.

"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Steve McBride,N/A,My Inspire 2 is pretty accurate - and when it is not - it is amusing,N/A,"I bought my Inspire 2 a couple months ago, and I just love it!What I use it for is as a heart rate monitor and to track my sleep.  It has a really long battery life - I recharge it about every 10 days (it sends me an email to remind me when it needs charging).  It is also really lightweight.My normal forms of exercise are: weights, treadmill, walks (our neighborhood is quite hilly), and yoga.  My fitbit does really well at tracking my heart rate on walks - and it leverages my phone's GPS for distance.  It sometimes does well at tracking intensity on the treadmill, and sometimes not.  How tightly you wear the watchband affects if it misses beats.  An amusing aspect of the heart rate monitor is - that something about going shopping at Costco with my wife sometimes causes my heart rate to go up quite a bit.  I think it is we naturally shop at different speeds.  I try to fob the increase in heart rate off as the romance of shopping together, but my wife is not buying it...  The fitbit will report those bouts of high heart rate as exercise.  Normally, though, the heart rate is pretty accurate - I was in the hospital for a little while - and one of the things I liked to do was compare my fitbit's heart rate measure - with that of the hospital's heart rate monitor.  In general they were within 1 beat of each other.  I use the Active Zone Minutes feature of fitbit to help me track my 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week.  Active Zone Minutes can be more or less accurate, so I don't follow them religiously, but more as a motivator to do more.As a sleep tracker my fitbit is also very useful.  I am trying to get more sleep -- and having an objective source of data gives me feedback on how I am doing .  I have noticed though, if you sit really still for a long period of time, such as in an emergency room, it interprets that as sleep.  I suppose sitting quietly is a form of rest, so I don't feel too bad about that.I find my fitbit very motivating -- it causes me to do more exercise than I would have otherwise.  I think the mind set that it promotes is very helpful.  It makes a great watch.  For the most part it is unobtrusive.  If you already have a smart-phone, and want to improve your health, the Inspire 2 is reasonably priced for what it gives.  So far I have not used the Premium features that much - so I don't have an opinion on that at this point.Cronometer (a nutrition tracking app - that can also be used to track biometrics) can be linked to my fitbit, and automatically grab some metrics - I find that very useful too.  Fitbit is mostly focused on exercise - I find it easier to use Cronometer to track food, blood pressure, blood glucose, weight etc...I did also try the fitbit smart scale but it did not work well for me, so I manually enter weight data into my fitbit app.The Inspire 2 is definitely a keeper and, for me, well worth the money.

Works Perfectly, great battery",N/A,"This Fitbit Inspire 2 has actually inspired me to do my 10, 000 steps a day, and it's fun seeing your progress and active minutes in tangible, measurable data. It's also the most comfortable band I've ever worn- very soft, and even though it's all plastic, it's solid, high quality plastic. Band fits securely even on my skinny wrists. The app is OK; could be more intuitive, but you get used to it. It's nice being able to see my resting heart rate go down with regular exercise, and the menstrual cycle tracker is useful too- has accurately warned me a couple days before I start my period. Battery life is EXCELLENT; much better than my old Charge 2. Lasts 7-10 days easily if you don't work out every single day. It actually IS water and sweat resistant as it claims, doesn't get as sticky or uncomfortable as some other smart watches or fitness trackers.There are a couple of things I don't like: the charger is proprietary, which means one more adapter and cable to pack instead of the widely used USB Type C. Also the squeeze to toggle modes function often activates when I bend my wrist backwards. I imagine this would be a dealbreaker if I did a lot of yoga, but even if you're playing racquet sports and wearing this on your non dominant hand, this shouldn't be an issue.Apart from that, I really can't think of any downsides. Would recommend for people who want to maintain or build a good level of fitness and don't want to charge their device too often.

Poor battery, no service center in India",N/A,"I purchased Inspire 2 from Amazon in India. After 5 months I started facing issues with charging it. This band will charge only if remaining battery life is 5% or 0.It used to take me day or 2 to get charging started once it was at 5% or less.When I raised this issue with Fitbit support they acknowledged & sent a replacement from Hong Kong as they have no service center in India.The replacement band has extremely dim light & its unuseable, I tried to change dim light settings to no avail. Both bands are useless now.

"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Steve McBride,N/A,My Inspire 2 is pretty accurate - and when it is not - it is amusing,N/A,"I bought my Inspire 2 a couple months ago, and I just love it!What I use it for is as a heart rate monitor and to track my sleep.  It has a really long battery life - I recharge it about every 10 days (it sends me an email to remind me when it needs charging).  It is also really lightweight.My normal forms of exercise are: weights, treadmill, walks (our neighborhood is quite hilly), and yoga.  My fitbit does really well at tracking my heart rate on walks - and it leverages my phone's GPS for distance.  It sometimes does well at tracking intensity on the treadmill, and sometimes not.  How tightly you wear the watchband affects if it misses beats.  An amusing aspect of the heart rate monitor is - that something about going shopping at Costco with my wife sometimes causes my heart rate to go up quite a bit.  I think it is we naturally shop at different speeds.  I try to fob the increase in heart rate off as the romance of shopping together, but my wife is not buying it...  The fitbit will report those bouts of high heart rate as exercise.  Normally, though, the heart rate is pretty accurate - I was in the hospital for a little while - and one of the things I liked to do was compare my fitbit's heart rate measure - with that of the hospital's heart rate monitor.  In general they were within 1 beat of each other.  I use the Active Zone Minutes feature of fitbit to help me track my 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week.  Active Zone Minutes can be more or less accurate, so I don't follow them religiously, but more as a motivator to do more.As a sleep tracker my fitbit is also very useful.  I am trying to get more sleep -- and having an objective source of data gives me feedback on how I am doing .  I have noticed though, if you sit really still for a long period of time, such as in an emergency room, it interprets that as sleep.  I suppose sitting quietly is a form of rest, so I don't feel too bad about that.I find my fitbit very motivating -- it causes me to do more exercise than I would have otherwise.  I think the mind set that it promotes is very helpful.  It makes a great watch.  For the most part it is unobtrusive.  If you already have a smart-phone, and want to improve your health, the Inspire 2 is reasonably priced for what it gives.  So far I have not used the Premium features that much - so I don't have an opinion on that at this point.Cronometer (a nutrition tracking app - that can also be used to track biometrics) can be linked to my fitbit, and automatically grab some metrics - I find that very useful too.  Fitbit is mostly focused on exercise - I find it easier to use Cronometer to track food, blood pressure, blood glucose, weight etc...I did also try the fitbit smart scale but it did not work well for me, so I manually enter weight data into my fitbit app.The Inspire 2 is definitely a keeper and, for me, well worth the money.

Works Perfectly, great battery",N/A,"This Fitbit Inspire 2 has actually inspired me to do my 10, 000 steps a day, and it's fun seeing your progress and active minutes in tangible, measurable data. It's also the most comfortable band I've ever worn- very soft, and even though it's all plastic, it's solid, high quality plastic. Band fits securely even on my skinny wrists. The app is OK; could be more intuitive, but you get used to it. It's nice being able to see my resting heart rate go down with regular exercise, and the menstrual cycle tracker is useful too- has accurately warned me a couple days before I start my period. Battery life is EXCELLENT; much better than my old Charge 2. Lasts 7-10 days easily if you don't work out every single day. It actually IS water and sweat resistant as it claims, doesn't get as sticky or uncomfortable as some other smart watches or fitness trackers.There are a couple of things I don't like: the charger is proprietary, which means one more adapter and cable to pack instead of the widely used USB Type C. Also the squeeze to toggle modes function often activates when I bend my wrist backwards. I imagine this would be a dealbreaker if I did a lot of yoga, but even if you're playing racquet sports and wearing this on your non dominant hand, this shouldn't be an issue.Apart from that, I really can't think of any downsides. Would recommend for people who want to maintain or build a good level of fitness and don't want to charge their device too often.

Poor battery, no service center in India",N/A,"I purchased Inspire 2 from Amazon in India. After 5 months I started facing issues with charging it. This band will charge only if remaining battery life is 5% or 0.It used to take me day or 2 to get charging started once it was at 5% or less.When I raised this issue with Fitbit support they acknowledged & sent a replacement from Hong Kong as they have no service center in India.The replacement band has extremely dim light & its unuseable, I tried to change dim light settings to no avail. Both bands are useless now.

"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Steve McBride,N/A,My Inspire 2 is pretty accurate - and when it is not - it is amusing,N/A,"I bought my Inspire 2 a couple months ago, and I just love it!What I use it for is as a heart rate monitor and to track my sleep.  It has a really long battery life - I recharge it about every 10 days (it sends me an email to remind me when it needs charging).  It is also really lightweight.My normal forms of exercise are: weights, treadmill, walks (our neighborhood is quite hilly), and yoga.  My fitbit does really well at tracking my heart rate on walks - and it leverages my phone's GPS for distance.  It sometimes does well at tracking intensity on the treadmill, and sometimes not.  How tightly you wear the watchband affects if it misses beats.  An amusing aspect of the heart rate monitor is - that something about going shopping at Costco with my wife sometimes causes my heart rate to go up quite a bit.  I think it is we naturally shop at different speeds.  I try to fob the increase in heart rate off as the romance of shopping together, but my wife is not buying it...  The fitbit will report those bouts of high heart rate as exercise.  Normally, though, the heart rate is pretty accurate - I was in the hospital for a little while - and one of the things I liked to do was compare my fitbit's heart rate measure - with that of the hospital's heart rate monitor.  In general they were within 1 beat of each other.  I use the Active Zone Minutes feature of fitbit to help me track my 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week.  Active Zone Minutes can be more or less accurate, so I don't follow them religiously, but more as a motivator to do more.As a sleep tracker my fitbit is also very useful.  I am trying to get more sleep -- and having an objective source of data gives me feedback on how I am doing .  I have noticed though, if you sit really still for a long period of time, such as in an emergency room, it interprets that as sleep.  I suppose sitting quietly is a form of rest, so I don't feel too bad about that.I find my fitbit very motivating -- it causes me to do more exercise than I would have otherwise.  I think the mind set that it promotes is very helpful.  It makes a great watch.  For the most part it is unobtrusive.  If you already have a smart-phone, and want to improve your health, the Inspire 2 is reasonably priced for what it gives.  So far I have not used the Premium features that much - so I don't have an opinion on that at this point.Cronometer (a nutrition tracking app - that can also be used to track biometrics) can be linked to my fitbit, and automatically grab some metrics - I find that very useful too.  Fitbit is mostly focused on exercise - I find it easier to use Cronometer to track food, blood pressure, blood glucose, weight etc...I did also try the fitbit smart scale but it did not work well for me, so I manually enter weight data into my fitbit app.The Inspire 2 is definitely a keeper and, for me, well worth the money.

Works Perfectly, great battery",N/A,"This Fitbit Inspire 2 has actually inspired me to do my 10, 000 steps a day, and it's fun seeing your progress and active minutes in tangible, measurable data. It's also the most comfortable band I've ever worn- very soft, and even though it's all plastic, it's solid, high quality plastic. Band fits securely even on my skinny wrists. The app is OK; could be more intuitive, but you get used to it. It's nice being able to see my resting heart rate go down with regular exercise, and the menstrual cycle tracker is useful too- has accurately warned me a couple days before I start my period. Battery life is EXCELLENT; much better than my old Charge 2. Lasts 7-10 days easily if you don't work out every single day. It actually IS water and sweat resistant as it claims, doesn't get as sticky or uncomfortable as some other smart watches or fitness trackers.There are a couple of things I don't like: the charger is proprietary, which means one more adapter and cable to pack instead of the widely used USB Type C. Also the squeeze to toggle modes function often activates when I bend my wrist backwards. I imagine this would be a dealbreaker if I did a lot of yoga, but even if you're playing racquet sports and wearing this on your non dominant hand, this shouldn't be an issue.Apart from that, I really can't think of any downsides. Would recommend for people who want to maintain or build a good level of fitness and don't want to charge their device too often.

Poor battery, no service center in India",N/A,"I purchased Inspire 2 from Amazon in India. After 5 months I started facing issues with charging it. This band will charge only if remaining battery life is 5% or 0.It used to take me day or 2 to get charging started once it was at 5% or less.When I raised this issue with Fitbit support they acknowledged & sent a replacement from Hong Kong as they have no service center in India.The replacement band has extremely dim light & its unuseable, I tried to change dim light settings to no avail.

"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Steve McBride,N/A,My Inspire 2 is pretty accurate - and when it is not - it is amusing,N/A,"I bought my Inspire 2 a couple months ago, and I just love it!What I use it for is as a heart rate monitor and to track my sleep.  It has a really long battery life - I recharge it about every 10 days (it sends me an email to remind me when it needs charging).  It is also really lightweight.My normal forms of exercise are: weights, treadmill, walks (our neighborhood is quite hilly), and yoga.  My fitbit does really well at tracking my heart rate on walks - and it leverages my phone's GPS for distance.  It sometimes does well at tracking intensity on the treadmill, and sometimes not.  How tightly you wear the watchband affects if it misses beats.  An amusing aspect of the heart rate monitor is - that something about going shopping at Costco with my wife sometimes causes my heart rate to go up quite a bit.  I think it is we naturally shop at different speeds.  I try to fob the increase in heart rate off as the romance of shopping together, but my wife is not buying it...  The fitbit will report those bouts of high heart rate as exercise.  Normally, though, the heart rate is pretty accurate - I was in the hospital for a little while - and one of the things I liked to do was compare my fitbit's heart rate measure - with that of the hospital's heart rate monitor.  In general they were within 1 beat of each other.  I use the Active Zone Minutes feature of fitbit to help me track my 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week.  Active Zone Minutes can be more or less accurate, so I don't follow them religiously, but more as a motivator to do more.As a sleep tracker my fitbit is also very useful.  I am trying to get more sleep -- and having an objective source of data gives me feedback on how I am doing .  I have noticed though, if you sit really still for a long period of time, such as in an emergency room, it interprets that as sleep.  I suppose sitting quietly is a form of rest, so I don't feel too bad about that.I find my fitbit very motivating -- it causes me to do more exercise than I would have otherwise.  I think the mind set that it promotes is very helpful.  It makes a great watch.  For the most part it is unobtrusive.  If you already have a smart-phone, and want to improve your health, the Inspire 2 is reasonably priced for what it gives.  So far I have not used the Premium features that much - so I don't have an opinion on that at this point.Cronometer (a nutrition tracking app - that can also be used to track biometrics) can be linked to my fitbit, and automatically grab some metrics - I find that very useful too.  Fitbit is mostly focused on exercise - I find it easier to use Cronometer to track food, blood pressure, blood glucose, weight etc...I did also try the fitbit smart scale but it did not work well for me, so I manually enter weight data into my fitbit app.The Inspire 2 is definitely a keeper and, for me, well worth the money.

Works Perfectly, great battery",N/A,"This Fitbit Inspire 2 has actually inspired me to do my 10, 000 steps a day, and it's fun seeing your progress and active minutes in tangible, measurable data. It's also the most comfortable band I've ever worn- very soft, and even though it's all plastic, it's solid, high quality plastic. Band fits securely even on my skinny wrists. The app is OK; could be more intuitive, but you get used to it. It's nice being able to see my resting heart rate go down with regular exercise, and the menstrual cycle tracker is useful too- has accurately warned me a couple days before I start my period. Battery life is EXCELLENT; much better than my old Charge 2. Lasts 7-10 days easily if you don't work out every single day. It actually IS water and sweat resistant as it claims, doesn't get as sticky or uncomfortable as some other smart watches or fitness trackers.There are a couple of things I don't like: the charger is proprietary, which means one more adapter and cable to pack instead of the widely used USB Type C. Also the squeeze to toggle modes function often activates when I bend my wrist backwards. I imagine this would be a dealbreaker if I did a lot of yoga, but even if you're playing racquet sports and wearing this on your non dominant hand, this shouldn't be an issue.Apart from that, I really can't think of any downsides. Would recommend for people who want to maintain or build a good level of fitness and don't want to charge their device too often.

"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Steve McBride,N/A,My Inspire 2 is pretty accurate - and when it is not - it is amusing,N/A,"I bought my Inspire 2 a couple months ago, and I just love it!What I use it for is as a heart rate monitor and to track my sleep.  It has a really long battery life - I recharge it about every 10 days (it sends me an email to remind me when it needs charging).  It is also really lightweight.My normal forms of exercise are: weights, treadmill, walks (our neighborhood is quite hilly), and yoga.  My fitbit does really well at tracking my heart rate on walks - and it leverages my phone's GPS for distance.  It sometimes does well at tracking intensity on the treadmill, and sometimes not.  How tightly you wear the watchband affects if it misses beats.  An amusing aspect of the heart rate monitor is - that something about going shopping at Costco with my wife sometimes causes my heart rate to go up quite a bit.  I think it is we naturally shop at different speeds.  I try to fob the increase in heart rate off as the romance of shopping together, but my wife is not buying it...  The fitbit will report those bouts of high heart rate as exercise.  Normally, though, the heart rate is pretty accurate - I was in the hospital for a little while - and one of the things I liked to do was compare my fitbit's heart rate measure - with that of the hospital's heart rate monitor.  In general they were within 1 beat of each other.  I use the Active Zone Minutes feature of fitbit to help me track my 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week.  Active Zone Minutes can be more or less accurate, so I don't follow them religiously, but more as a motivator to do more.As a sleep tracker my fitbit is also very useful.  I am trying to get more sleep -- and having an objective source of data gives me feedback on how I am doing .  I have noticed though, if you sit really still for a long period of time, such as in an emergency room, it interprets that as sleep.  I suppose sitting quietly is a form of rest, so I don't feel too bad about that.I find my fitbit very motivating -- it causes me to do more exercise than I would have otherwise.  I think the mind set that it promotes is very helpful.  It makes a great watch.  For the most part it is unobtrusive.  If you already have a smart-phone, and want to improve your health, the Inspire 2 is reasonably priced for what it gives.  So far I have not used the Premium features that much - so I don't have an opinion on that at this point.Cronometer (a nutrition tracking app - that can also be used to track biometrics) can be linked to my fitbit, and automatically grab some metrics - I find that very useful too.  Fitbit is mostly focused on exercise - I find it easier to use Cronometer to track food, blood pressure, blood glucose, weight etc...I did also try the fitbit smart scale but it did not work well for me, so I manually enter weight data into my fitbit app.The Inspire 2 is definitely a keeper and, for me, well worth the money.

So far I have not used the Premium features that much - so I don't have an opinion on that at this point.Cronometer (a nutrition tracking app - that can also be used to track biometrics) can be linked to my fitbit, and automatically grab some metrics - I find that very useful too.  Fitbit is mostly focused on exercise - I find it easier to use Cronometer to track food, blood pressure, blood glucose, weight etc...I did also try the fitbit smart scale but it did not work well for me, so I manually enter weight data into my fitbit app.The Inspire 2 is definitely a keeper and, for me, well worth the money.

Works Perfectly, great battery",N/A,"This Fitbit Inspire 2 has actually inspired me to do my 10, 000 steps a day, and it's fun seeing your progress and active minutes in tangible, measurable data. It's also the most comfortable band I've ever worn- very soft, and even though it's all plastic, it's solid, high quality plastic. Band fits securely even on my skinny wrists. The app is OK; could be more intuitive, but you get used to it. It's nice being able to see my resting heart rate go down with regular exercise, and the menstrual cycle tracker is useful too- has accurately warned me a couple days before I start my period. Battery life is EXCELLENT; much better than my old Charge 2. Lasts 7-10 days easily if you don't work out every single day. It actually IS water and sweat resistant as it claims, doesn't get as sticky or uncomfortable as some other smart watches or fitness trackers.There are a couple of things I don't like: the charger is proprietary, which means one more adapter and cable to pack instead of the widely used USB Type C. Also the squeeze to toggle modes function often activates when I bend my wrist backwards. I imagine this would be a dealbreaker if I did a lot of yoga, but even if you're playing racquet sports and wearing this on your non dominant hand, this shouldn't be an issue.Apart from that, I really can't think of any downsides. Would recommend for people who want to maintain or build a good level of fitness and don't want to charge their device too often.

"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Steve McBride,N/A,My Inspire 2 is pretty accurate - and when it is not - it is amusing,N/A,"I bought my Inspire 2 a couple months ago, and I just love it!What I use it for is as a heart rate monitor and to track my sleep.  It has a really long battery life - I recharge it about every 10 days (it sends me an email to remind me when it needs charging).  It is also really lightweight.My normal forms of exercise are: weights, treadmill, walks (our neighborhood is quite hilly), and yoga.  My fitbit does really well at tracking my heart rate on walks - and it leverages my phone's GPS for distance.  It sometimes does well at tracking intensity on the treadmill, and sometimes not.  How tightly you wear the watchband affects if it misses beats.  An amusing aspect of the heart rate monitor is - that something about going shopping at Costco with my wife sometimes causes my heart rate to go up quite a bit.  I think it is we naturally shop at different speeds.  I try to fob the increase in heart rate off as the romance of shopping together, but my wife is not buying it...  The fitbit will report those bouts of high heart rate as exercise.  Normally, though, the heart rate is pretty accurate - I was in the hospital for a little while - and one of the things I liked to do was compare my fitbit's heart rate measure - with that of the hospital's heart rate monitor.  In general they were within 1 beat of each other.  I use the Active Zone Minutes feature of fitbit to help me track my 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week.  Active Zone Minutes can be more or less accurate, so I don't follow them religiously, but more as a motivator to do more.As a sleep tracker my fitbit is also very useful.  I am trying to get more sleep -- and having an objective source of data gives me feedback on how I am doing .  I have noticed though, if you sit really still for a long period of time, such as in an emergency room, it interprets that as sleep.  I suppose sitting quietly is a form of rest, so I don't feel too bad about that.I find my fitbit very motivating -- it causes me to do more exercise than I would have otherwise.  I think the mind set that it promotes is very helpful.  It makes a great watch.  For the most part it is unobtrusive.

I suppose sitting quietly is a form of rest, so I don't feel too bad about that.I find my fitbit very motivating -- it causes me to do more exercise than I would have otherwise.  I think the mind set that it promotes is very helpful.  It makes a great watch.  For the most part it is unobtrusive.  If you already have a smart-phone, and want to improve your health, the Inspire 2 is reasonably priced for what it gives.  So far I have not used the Premium features that much - so I don't have an opinion on that at this point.Cronometer (a nutrition tracking app - that can also be used to track biometrics) can be linked to my fitbit, and automatically grab some metrics - I find that very useful too.  Fitbit is mostly focused on exercise - I find it easier to use Cronometer to track food, blood pressure, blood glucose, weight etc...I did also try the fitbit smart scale but it did not work well for me, so I manually enter weight data into my fitbit app.The Inspire 2 is definitely a keeper and, for me, well worth the money.

Works Perfectly, great battery",N/A,"This Fitbit Inspire 2 has actually inspired me to do my 10, 000 steps a day, and it's fun seeing your progress and active minutes in tangible, measurable data. It's also the most comfortable band I've ever worn- very soft, and even though it's all plastic, it's solid, high quality plastic. Band fits securely even on my skinny wrists. The app is OK; could be more intuitive, but you get used to it. It's nice being able to see my resting heart rate go down with regular exercise, and the menstrual cycle tracker is useful too- has accurately warned me a couple days before I start my period. Battery life is EXCELLENT; much better than my old Charge 2. Lasts 7-10 days easily if you don't work out every single day. It actually IS water and sweat resistant as it claims, doesn't get as sticky or uncomfortable as some other smart watches or fitness trackers.There are a couple of things I don't like: the charger is proprietary, which means one more adapter and cable to pack instead of the widely used USB Type C. Also the squeeze to toggle modes function often activates when I bend my wrist backwards. I imagine this would be a dealbreaker if I did a lot of yoga, but even if you're playing racquet sports and wearing this on your non dominant hand, this shouldn't be an issue.Apart from that, I really can't think of any downsides. Would recommend for people who want to maintain or build a good level of fitness and don't want to charge their device too often.

"Fitbit Inspire 2 Health & Fitness Tracker with a Free 1-Year Premium Trial, 24/7 Heart Rate, Black/Black, One Size (S & L Bands Included)",Steve McBride,N/A,My Inspire 2 is pretty accurate - and when it is not - it is amusing,N/A,"I bought my Inspire 2 a couple months ago, and I just love it!What I use it for is as a heart rate monitor and to track my sleep.  It has a really long battery life - I recharge it about every 10 days (it sends me an email to remind me when it needs charging).  It is also really lightweight.My normal forms of exercise are: weights, treadmill, walks (our neighborhood is quite hilly), and yoga.  My fitbit does really well at tracking my heart rate on walks - and it leverages my phone's GPS for distance.  It sometimes does well at tracking intensity on the treadmill, and sometimes not.  How tightly you wear the watchband affects if it misses beats.  An amusing aspect of the heart rate monitor is - that something about going shopping at Costco with my wife sometimes causes my heart rate to go up quite a bit.  I think it is we naturally shop at different speeds.  I try to fob the increase in heart rate off as the romance of shopping together, but my wife is not buying it...  The fitbit will report those bouts of high heart rate as exercise.  Normally, though, the heart rate is pretty accurate - I was in the hospital for a little while - and one of the things I liked to do was compare my fitbit's heart rate measure - with that of the hospital's heart rate monitor.  In general they were within 1 beat of each other.  I use the Active Zone Minutes feature of fitbit to help me track my 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week.  Active Zone Minutes can be more or less accurate, so I don't follow them religiously, but more as a motivator to do more.As a sleep tracker my fitbit is also very useful.  I am trying to get more sleep -- and having an objective source of data gives me feedback on how I am doing .

Active Zone Minutes can be more or less accurate, so I don't follow them religiously, but more as a motivator to do more.As a sleep tracker my fitbit is also very useful.  I am trying to get more sleep -- and having an objective source of data gives me feedback on how I am doing .  I have noticed though, if you sit really still for a long period of time, such as in an emergency room, it interprets that as sleep.  I suppose sitting quietly is a form of rest, so I don't feel too bad about that.I find my fitbit very motivating -- it causes me to do more exercise than I would have otherwise.  I think the mind set that it promotes is very helpful.  It makes a great watch.  For the most part it is unobtrusive.  If you already have a smart-phone, and want to improve your health, the Inspire 2 is reasonably priced for what it gives.  So far I have not used the Premium features that much - so I don't have an opinion on that at this point.Cronometer (a nutrition tracking app - that can also be used to track biometrics) can be linked to my fitbit, and automatically grab some metrics - I find that very useful too.  Fitbit is mostly focused on exercise - I find it easier to use Cronometer to track food, blood pressure, blood glucose, weight etc...I did also try the fitbit smart scale but it did not work well for me, so I manually enter weight data into my fitbit app.The Inspire 2 is definitely a keeper and, for me, well worth the money.

Works Perfectly, great battery",N/A,"This Fitbit Inspire 2 has actually inspired me to do my 10, 000 steps a day, and it's fun seeing your progress and active minutes in tangible, measurable data. It's also the most comfortable band I've ever worn- very soft, and even though it's all plastic, it's solid, high quality plastic. Band fits securely even on my skinny wrists. The app is OK; could be more intuitive, but you get used to it. It's nice being able to see my resting heart rate go down with regular exercise, and the menstrual cycle tracker is useful too- has accurately warned me a couple days before I start my period. Battery life is EXCELLENT; much better than my old Charge 2. Lasts 7-10 days easily if you don't work out every single day. It actually IS water and sweat resistant as it claims, doesn't get as sticky or uncomfortable as some other smart watches or fitness trackers.There are a couple of things I don't like: the charger is proprietary, which means one more adapter and cable to pack instead of the widely used USB Type C. Also the squeeze to toggle modes function often activates when I bend my wrist backwards. I imagine this would be a dealbreaker if I did a lot of yoga, but even if you're playing racquet sports and wearing this on your non dominant hand, this shouldn't be an issue.Apart from that, I really can't think of any downsides. Would recommend for people who want to maintain or build a good level of fitness and don't want to charge their device too often.

It has a really long battery life - I recharge it about every 10 days (it sends me an email to remind me when it needs charging).  It is also really lightweight.My normal forms of exercise are: weights, treadmill, walks (our neighborhood is quite hilly), and yoga.

How tightly you wear the watchband affects if it misses beats.  An amusing aspect of the heart rate monitor is - that something about going shopping at Costco with my wife sometimes causes my heart rate to go up quite a bit.  I think it is we naturally shop at different speeds.  I try to fob the increase in heart rate off as the romance of shopping together, but my wife is not buying it...

I think it is we naturally shop at different speeds.  I try to fob the increase in heart rate off as the romance of shopping together, but my wife is not buying it...  The fitbit will report those bouts of high heart rate as exercise.  Normally, though, the heart rate is pretty accurate - I was in the hospital for a little while - and one of the things I liked to do was compare my fitbit's heart rate measure - with that of the hospital's heart rate monitor.  In general they were within 1 beat of each other.  I use the Active Zone Minutes feature of fitbit to help me track my 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week.  Active Zone Minutes can be more or less accurate, so I don't follow them religiously, but more as a motivator to do more.As a sleep tracker my fitbit is also very useful.  I am trying to get more sleep -- and having an objective source of data gives me feedback on how I am doing .  I have noticed though, if you sit really still for a long period of time, such as in an emergency room, it interprets that as sleep.  I suppose sitting quietly is a form of rest, so I don't feel too bad about that.I find my fitbit very motivating -- it causes me to do more exercise than I would have otherwise.  I think the mind set that it promotes is very helpful.  It makes a great watch.  For the most part it is unobtrusive.  If you already have a smart-phone, and want to improve your health, the Inspire 2 is reasonably priced for what it gives.  So far I have not used the Premium features that much - so I don't have an opinion on that at this point.Cronometer (a nutrition tracking app - that can also be used to track biometrics) can be linked to my fitbit, and automatically grab some metrics - I find that very useful too.  Fitbit is mostly focused on exercise - I find it easier to use Cronometer to track food, blood pressure, blood glucose, weight etc...I did also try the fitbit smart scale but it did not work well for me, so I manually enter weight data into my fitbit app.The Inspire 2 is definitely a keeper and, for me, well worth the money.

Works Perfectly, great battery",N/A,"This Fitbit Inspire 2 has actually inspired me to do my 10, 000 steps a day, and it's fun seeing your progress and active minutes in tangible, measurable data. It's also the most comfortable band I've ever worn- very soft, and even though it's all plastic, it's solid, high quality plastic. Band fits securely even on my skinny wrists. The app is OK; could be more intuitive, but you get used to it. It's nice being able to see my resting heart rate go down with regular exercise, and the menstrual cycle tracker is useful too- has accurately warned me a couple days before I start my period. Battery life is EXCELLENT; much better than my old Charge 2. Lasts 7-10 days easily if you don't work out every single day. It actually IS water and sweat resistant as it claims, doesn't get as sticky or uncomfortable as some other smart watches or fitness trackers.There are a couple of things I don't like: the charger is proprietary, which means one more adapter and cable to pack instead of the widely used USB Type C. Also the squeeze to toggle modes function often activates when I bend my wrist backwards. I imagine this would be a dealbreaker if I did a lot of yoga, but even if you're playing racquet sports and wearing this on your non dominant hand, this shouldn't be an issue.Apart from that, I really can't think of any downsides. Would recommend for people who want to maintain or build a good level of fitness and don't want to charge their device too often.

My fitbit does really well at tracking my heart rate on walks - and it leverages my phone's GPS for distance.  It sometimes does well at tracking intensity on the treadmill, and sometimes not.  How tightly you wear the watchband affects if it misses beats.  An amusing aspect of the heart rate monitor is - that something about going shopping at Costco with my wife sometimes causes my heart rate to go up quite a bit.  I think it is we naturally shop at different speeds.  I try to fob the increase in heart rate off as the romance of shopping together, but my wife is not buying it...  The fitbit will report those bouts of high heart rate as exercise.  Normally, though, the heart rate is pretty accurate - I was in the hospital for a little while - and one of the things I liked to do was compare my fitbit's heart rate measure - with that of the hospital's heart rate monitor.  In general they were within 1 beat of each other.  I use the Active Zone Minutes feature of fitbit to help me track my 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week.  Active Zone Minutes can be more or less accurate, so I don't follow them religiously, but more as a motivator to do more.As a sleep tracker my fitbit is also very useful.  I am trying to get more sleep -- and having an objective source of data gives me feedback on how I am doing .  I have noticed though, if you sit really still for a long period of time, such as in an emergency room, it interprets that as sleep.  I suppose sitting quietly is a form of rest, so I don't feel too bad about that.I find my fitbit very motivating -- it causes me to do more exercise than I would have otherwise.  I think the mind set that it promotes is very helpful.  It makes a great watch.  For the most part it is unobtrusive.  If you already have a smart-phone, and want to improve your health, the Inspire 2 is reasonably priced for what it gives.  So far I have not used the Premium features that much - so I don't have an opinion on that at this point.Cronometer (a nutrition tracking app - that can also be used to track biometrics) can be linked to my fitbit, and automatically grab some metrics - I find that very useful too.  Fitbit is mostly focused on exercise - I find it easier to use Cronometer to track food, blood pressure, blood glucose, weight etc...I did also try the fitbit smart scale but it did not work well for me, so I manually enter weight data into my fitbit app.The Inspire 2 is definitely a keeper and, for me, well worth the money.

Works Perfectly, great battery",N/A,"This Fitbit Inspire 2 has actually inspired me to do my 10, 000 steps a day, and it's fun seeing your progress and active minutes in tangible, measurable data. It's also the most comfortable band I've ever worn- very soft, and even though it's all plastic, it's solid, high quality plastic. Band fits securely even on my skinny wrists. The app is OK; could be more intuitive, but you get used to it. It's nice being able to see my resting heart rate go down with regular exercise, and the menstrual cycle tracker is useful too- has accurately warned me a couple days before I start my period. Battery life is EXCELLENT; much better than my old Charge 2. Lasts 7-10 days easily if you don't work out every single day. It actually IS water and sweat resistant as it claims, doesn't get as sticky or uncomfortable as some other smart watches or fitness trackers.There are a couple of things I don't like: the charger is proprietary, which means one more adapter and cable to pack instead of the widely used USB Type C. Also the squeeze to toggle modes function often activates when I bend my wrist backwards. I imagine this would be a dealbreaker if I did a lot of yoga, but even if you're playing racquet sports and wearing this on your non dominant hand, this shouldn't be an issue.Apart from that, I really can't think of any downsides. Would recommend for people who want to maintain or build a good level of fitness and don't want to charge their device too often.

It mostly suits me for helping me change my sleeping routine which is very basic need but i used to suck at it!. Making the sleep patterns so accurate and in visual graphics make it easier for me to understand my sleep and how my body responds. Even though I'm the last person to go for a workout, this watch has made me way more active than before!

Good one!",N/A,"I've been using Versa 4 for a month now. It was hard decision to choose between versa 3 & 4. Since i wasn't upgrading any fitbit device I'm new to the fitbit community i went on with the latest buy versa 4. Gotta say I'm impressed so far. It mostly suits me for helping me change my sleeping routine which is very basic need but i used to suck at it!. Making the sleep patterns so accurate and in visual graphics make it easier for me to understand my sleep and how my body responds. Even though I'm the last person to go for a workout, this watch has made me way more active than before!

Good one!",N/A,"I've been using Versa 4 for a month now. It was hard decision to choose between versa 3 & 4. Since i wasn't upgrading any fitbit device I'm new to the fitbit community i went on with the latest buy versa 4. Gotta say I'm impressed so far. It mostly suits me for helping me change my sleeping routine which is very basic need but i used to suck at it!. Making the sleep patterns so accurate and in visual graphics make it easier for me to understand my sleep and how my body responds. Even though I'm the last person to go for a workout, this watch has made me way more active than before!

Probably the most reliable minimalist option",N/A,"This is not a smart watch and does not compare with one. It's not even an advanced fitness tracker. But use it as a minimalist, day-to-day activity, sleep, and heart-rate monitor and it performs exceptionally well.The step tracking is unusually liberal and one needs to scale it down by 5-10%. Heart rate is as accurate as it gets and that's the key use-case of having a tracker in the first place. The sleep tracking is also quite reliable. There are a number of premium features in the app (chargeable after 6 months).The battery life is awesome. I get 14+ days against an advertised 10 days by not enabling GPS feed from mobile and disabling auto-on of main dial. I assume even with those features the battery would easily last 12 days or so.Two complaints: the font size on the main dial is very small for the step count / heart rate and the app does not display the running / walking speed but the pace (minutes per km). Unfortunately, there is no option to change either of the two.

But given even Mi Band 5 was much better at INR 2000, tough luck. Also remember, that Fitbit has no Service Centre in India.The No Returns policy is insidious.

I've used this a couple of times myself, comparing with my Charge 5. I like its minimal form factor, lightweight but powerful build. The accurate metrics and bright display makes it perfect for workouts too!It's a bit expensive for the current pricing, but with deals going as low as 6.5k, it's a very good choice.

Great for fitness tracking!",N/A,"I’ve been using an Apple Watch for the longest time. Recently I bought this Fitbit only for 2 reasons, one to track my sleep (no other tracker does it like Fitbit) & second because the battery life of the Apple Watch is bad & the Apple Watch is very big and heavy. Fitbit is super light and comfy.Now that I’m using this Fitbit for tracking, I’m so impressed! It’s so easy to use & log the data of the food that I consume & see how many calories I’ve burned against the calories that I’ve consumed. Moreover, it’s super easy to keep a track of my overall fitness! If fitness is what you want to track, go for a Fitbit even if you have an Apple Watch. Fitbit is far better for overall tracking.

It's an investment!",N/A,"I will keep it plain and simple.1. Quality: You would get more than what you are paying for. Sturdy built, close to accurate tracking. The built is small enough to not trouble your while you are asleep and yet the screen is big enough that you won't need glasses to read.2. Battery life: Used it with its auto wake mode on which is essentially gesture turn on and I got a solid 10 days of battery. It charges quickly to 100% in less than 30 mins.3. It has great features, but understand that it has its limitation being just a tracker, that too a budget friendly one.If you are looking for a tracker, to track sleep, steps and heart rate and something that won't bother your much and don't need your attention for charging every other day, this is the best option. Got the free membership of 6 months without calling any support or such. Also, yearly membership in India is around 1000 rs which when compared to that in America (~$120) is dirt cheap.

Probably the most reliable minimalist option",N/A,"This is not a smart watch and does not compare with one. It's not even an advanced fitness tracker. But use it as a minimalist, day-to-day activity, sleep, and heart-rate monitor and it performs exceptionally well.The step tracking is unusually liberal and one needs to scale it down by 5-10%. Heart rate is as accurate as it gets and that's the key use-case of having a tracker in the first place. The sleep tracking is also quite reliable. There are a number of premium features in the app (chargeable after 6 months).The battery life is awesome. I get 14+ days against an advertised 10 days by not enabling GPS feed from mobile and disabling auto-on of main dial. I assume even with those features the battery would easily last 12 days or so.Two complaints: the font size on the main dial is very small for the step count / heart rate and the app does not display the running / walking speed but the pace (minutes per km). Unfortunately, there is no option to change either of the two.

But given even Mi Band 5 was much better at INR 2000, tough luck. Also remember, that Fitbit has no Service Centre in India.The No Returns policy is insidious.

Long-term review...",N/A,"Bought this for my mother during the previous Great Indian Festival (around 3 months ago). Great watch for fitness tracking! I've used this a couple of times myself, comparing with my Charge 5. I like its minimal form factor, lightweight but powerful build. The accurate metrics and bright display makes it perfect for workouts too!It's a bit expensive for the current pricing, but with deals going as low as 6.5k, it's a very good choice.

Great for fitness tracking!",N/A,"I’ve been using an Apple Watch for the longest time. Recently I bought this Fitbit only for 2 reasons, one to track my sleep (no other tracker does it like Fitbit) & second because the battery life of the Apple Watch is bad & the Apple Watch is very big and heavy. Fitbit is super light and comfy.Now that I’m using this Fitbit for tracking, I’m so impressed! It’s so easy to use & log the data of the food that I consume & see how many calories I’ve burned against the calories that I’ve consumed. Moreover, it’s super easy to keep a track of my overall fitness! If fitness is what you want to track, go for a Fitbit even if you have an Apple Watch. Fitbit is far better for overall tracking.

It's an investment!",N/A,"I will keep it plain and simple.1. Quality: You would get more than what you are paying for. Sturdy built, close to accurate tracking. The built is small enough to not trouble your while you are asleep and yet the screen is big enough that you won't need glasses to read.2. Battery life: Used it with its auto wake mode on which is essentially gesture turn on and I got a solid 10 days of battery. It charges quickly to 100% in less than 30 mins.3. It has great features, but understand that it has its limitation being just a tracker, that too a budget friendly one.If you are looking for a tracker, to track sleep, steps and heart rate and something that won't bother your much and don't need your attention for charging every other day, this is the best option. Got the free membership of 6 months without calling any support or such. Also, yearly membership in India is around 1000 rs which when compared to that in America (~$120) is dirt cheap.

I assume even with those features the battery would easily last 12 days or so.Two complaints: the font size on the main dial is very small for the step count / heart rate and the app does not display the running / walking speed but the pace (minutes per km). Unfortunately, there is no option to change either of the two.

Middling product with a price that’s premium for most Indians.",N/A,"If I hadn’t used any other fitness bands that are less than 1/3rd the price and whose every feature except the UI and finishing was better, I would’ve given this 5 stars. But given even Mi Band 5 was much better at INR 2000, tough luck. Also remember, that Fitbit has no Service Centre in India.The No Returns policy is insidious. I’ve spent about 9k and got a brand name, nice finishing and good UI to show for it.

Long-term review...",N/A,"Bought this for my mother during the previous Great Indian Festival (around 3 months ago). Great watch for fitness tracking! I've used this a couple of times myself, comparing with my Charge 5. I like its minimal form factor, lightweight but powerful build. The accurate metrics and bright display makes it perfect for workouts too!It's a bit expensive for the current pricing, but with deals going as low as 6.5k, it's a very good choice.

Great for fitness tracking!",N/A,"I’ve been using an Apple Watch for the longest time. Recently I bought this Fitbit only for 2 reasons, one to track my sleep (no other tracker does it like Fitbit) & second because the battery life of the Apple Watch is bad & the Apple Watch is very big and heavy. Fitbit is super light and comfy.Now that I’m using this Fitbit for tracking, I’m so impressed! It’s so easy to use & log the data of the food that I consume & see how many calories I’ve burned against the calories that I’ve consumed. Moreover, it’s super easy to keep a track of my overall fitness! If fitness is what you want to track, go for a Fitbit even if you have an Apple Watch. Fitbit is far better for overall tracking.

It's an investment!",N/A,"I will keep it plain and simple.1. Quality: You would get more than what you are paying for. Sturdy built, close to accurate tracking. The built is small enough to not trouble your while you are asleep and yet the screen is big enough that you won't need glasses to read.2. Battery life: Used it with its auto wake mode on which is essentially gesture turn on and I got a solid 10 days of battery. It charges quickly to 100% in less than 30 mins.3. It has great features, but understand that it has its limitation being just a tracker, that too a budget friendly one.If you are looking for a tracker, to track sleep, steps and heart rate and something that won't bother your much and don't need your attention for charging every other day, this is the best option. Got the free membership of 6 months without calling any support or such. Also, yearly membership in India is around 1000 rs which when compared to that in America (~$120) is dirt cheap.

The accurate metrics and bright display makes it perfect for workouts too!It's a bit expensive for the current pricing, but with deals going as low as 6.5k, it's a very good choice.

Great for fitness tracking!",N/A,"I’ve been using an Apple Watch for the longest time. Recently I bought this Fitbit only for 2 reasons, one to track my sleep (no other tracker does it like Fitbit) & second because the battery life of the Apple Watch is bad & the Apple Watch is very big and heavy. Fitbit is super light and comfy.Now that I’m using this Fitbit for tracking, I’m so impressed! It’s so easy to use & log the data of the food that I consume & see how many calories I’ve burned against the calories that I’ve consumed. Moreover, it’s super easy to keep a track of my overall fitness! If fitness is what you want to track, go for a Fitbit even if you have an Apple Watch. Fitbit is far better for overall tracking.

Not worth it",N/A,"Pros:Premium designCons:Steps counts are inaccurate and overcounts by some distance. It can be controlled by configuration either. Definitely not worth the premium price it costs for. Mi might be cheap but is far more accurate and does the both brilliantly.

It's an investment!",N/A,"I will keep it plain and simple.1. Quality: You would get more than what you are paying for. Sturdy built, close to accurate tracking. The built is small enough to not trouble your while you are asleep and yet the screen is big enough that you won't need glasses to read.2. Battery life: Used it with its auto wake mode on which is essentially gesture turn on and I got a solid 10 days of battery. It charges quickly to 100% in less than 30 mins.3. It has great features, but understand that it has its limitation being just a tracker, that too a budget friendly one.If you are looking for a tracker, to track sleep, steps and heart rate and something that won't bother your much and don't need your attention for charging every other day, this is the best option. Got the free membership of 6 months without calling any support or such. Also, yearly membership in India is around 1000 rs which when compared to that in America (~$120) is dirt cheap.

Does a great job for tracking steps, distance, calories burned, and heart rate. Also provides information on sleep stats, blood oxygen levels, and resting heart rate, which are the things I was most interested in. The premium features in the app are pretty good too and were free for 6 months. These give you information on energy levels, sleep stages, exercise classes. Fun and useful. Worth the price.

Her last watch was Fitbit Charge 2. Compared with that, this watch is cheaper. The display is colored and crisp. It's rather intuitive to use and sync to the fitbit app on the iPhone.However, it doesn't seem to come with a GPS, so the tracking is not that accurate if not used with a phone.It's good enough for the kids I guess.

Almost a perfect smart sports watch with GPS except floor counts",N/A,"I am writing this review after 1 month usuage. 1. Battery backup- Superb. With daily 90 mins GPS usuage, it will run around 3 days. Without GPS, easily it runs for 6~7 days.2. GPS: Nearly perfect tracking but It takes around 2 mins to receive GPS signal in open area.3. Step Counts: No issue, perfect. But if you shake your hands in sitting position, it counts steps wrongly.4. Heart Rate: Monitor continuously, no issue.5. Floor Counts: I am not happy with the floor counts, someday it counts perfectly but most of the days, it counts wrongly, either more or less. For example, today I have climbed 4 times to my 3rd floor office which is 12 floors total but it has counted only 8 floors.6. Water Resistant: I haven’t swim with it but I wash the watch daily after workout in tap water, no issue.7. Charging: Very fast, from 5% to 100% it takes around 75 mins.8. Sleep Analysis: Good with all details analysis like deep sleep, NREM sleep etc.9. Connectivity with Connect app: It sync perfectly with my iphone Connect app and also sync the data with Strava and iphone Health data.10. Visibility: Even in full sunlight, I can see all the data without any issue. At dark, the backlight is perfect at 40% brightness to read all data.11. Notification and Call Receiving or Rejecting: I can see all notification headlines and can accept or reject calls very easily of my iPhone.12. Weight and feeling: Very light weight, doesn’t give me any bad feeling.Overall a good smart sports watch with a decent design and look to wear in formal and casual clothes.

Great fitness tracker with basic smart abilities.",N/A,"Bought it during this festive season, been using it since 19th. It took a day more for Amazon to deliver it than promised, but it arrived sealed and intact. In the box you will find the watch, 3 stickers, charger and the manual. The smartwatch charges quick, even through USB port power. One will have to download 3 apps. Garmin Connect for metrics, Garmin pay and device settings, Garmin Connect IQ for downloading custom watch faces and Garmin Express on the laptop for registration, firmware and map updates and such. Setting this up was easy and the watch was up and ready to go in no time.Coming to the watch, for most of us who are used to high quality, high refresh rate AMOLED displays, the transflective low resolution display can be a bummer, however the upside is that the display is extremely easy to read in sunlight and outdoors and it will grow on you gradually. A press on the button from the main screen takes you to the preloaded work outs screen whereas a long press on the same will take you to the settings(power, GPS, brightness etc). You can swipe up or down to access the widgets or one can use the haptic touch slider on the left hand side to scroll, though the latter can be a hit or miss. At times the watch might take a moment to catch its breath, but its been running smooth so far. Step tracking and HR monitoring is excellent, and one can customize the preloaded workouts according to their style. Not so sure regarding the floor counting accuracy as i'm yet to test it, and even more so on the sleep tracking abilities of the watch, but its an interesting piece of information. Yet to do an outdoor activity thanks to the pandemic, so can't comment on the GPS tracking ability, but i guess it will do that job pretty well, being a Garmin product. The watch comes with basic smart abilities like controlling music, approve/deny authentication requests, message notifications(whatsapp, messages and such), control music etc. There is a limit to the number of watch faces one can have in the watch, and this can easily be downloaded from the Connect IQ store. The tansflective display is easy on the battery too, and the watch lasts upto 5 days which is pretty good. Downloads to the watch or making changes to the watch faces drains the battery faster, otherwise its pretty much normal.The Connect app is really good and user friendly giving all sorts of metrics regarding the activities we did. None of the banks support Garmin Pay, so can't use it, which doesn't bother me much. Overall, pretty good in its line of work and i believe the upcoming updates will only make it better. Pretty satisfied with its performance and a happy customer. A keeper for sure. Thanks Amazon, peace.

"Garmin Vivoactive 3 GPS Smartwatch, 1.2 inch",Jon Skaehill,N/A,(Still) My FAVORITE watch (over a year later),N/A,"Update: I’ve had this now for over a year and I still absolutely love it. The bands have held up, the watch face protectors I got sincerely save my watch and I’ve only replaced it once!Update: 8 month check in!  I still love it!  It tracks gym work outs, road workouts, yoga and more. I can track my sleep and heart rate when I’m stressed and so much more. Still love it!Original review: I have had this watch for 6 months and I wear it daily.  I absolutely LOVE this watch. I researched for months before purchasing one and I’m so glad I got this one. I previously had a Garmin Forerunner and while it did the job I didn’t love it. Before that I went through FitBit watches left and right.  They definitely are not built to last.  My only regret with the VivoActive is that I didn’t buy a watch base in white, I purchased black.The battery life isn’t awesome. Mine lasts a full 4 days, maybe 5 if I don’t workout as much.  But since I work from home that’s no big deal.  I do have to take the cord with me when I travel. PSA: take off your watch before you go thru security at the airport. It gives me trouble every single time. Phone notifications seem to drain the battery.  I wish I could tell the watch “only give me call, text and amazon delivery notifications.”  But your watch options are to receive all notifications that come to your phone or no notifications.This thing is durable and I purchased different bands that I love. These bands tuck into themselves so there’s no bulk on my wrist. I also purchased a protective film for the glass, but I ordered that one “door frame” too late and got a nick in the glass of my Garmin. The film cover is great and I forget it’s even there. The touchscreen still works just fine with the cover on it.I keep the charging cord in my car. I recharge my watch while driving. It charges pretty quickly.The green heart rate lights can be a little annoying at night. I’m sure there’s a way to turn them off but I haven’t figured it out yet.I also downloaded a different watch face. I like that I can see everything in one place: Time, date, HR, steps, battery life, and it even shows that I have 1 alarm set.I like the app where I can see what all I’ve done on the calendar view. If you don’t synch a few times a week the sync process can a bit. Maybe 5 min at the most for several week’s worth of data.I’m still very pleased with this Garmin. I wear it every single day!

Great fitness tracker with basic smart abilities.",N/A,"Bought it during this festive season, been using it since 19th. It took a day more for Amazon to deliver it than promised, but it arrived sealed and intact. In the box you will find the watch, 3 stickers, charger and the manual. The smartwatch charges quick, even through USB port power. One will have to download 3 apps. Garmin Connect for metrics, Garmin pay and device settings, Garmin Connect IQ for downloading custom watch faces and Garmin Express on the laptop for registration, firmware and map updates and such. Setting this up was easy and the watch was up and ready to go in no time.Coming to the watch, for most of us who are used to high quality, high refresh rate AMOLED displays, the transflective low resolution display can be a bummer, however the upside is that the display is extremely easy to read in sunlight and outdoors and it will grow on you gradually. A press on the button from the main screen takes you to the preloaded work outs screen whereas a long press on the same will take you to the settings(power, GPS, brightness etc). You can swipe up or down to access the widgets or one can use the haptic touch slider on the left hand side to scroll, though the latter can be a hit or miss. At times the watch might take a moment to catch its breath, but its been running smooth so far. Step tracking and HR monitoring is excellent, and one can customize the preloaded workouts according to their style. Not so sure regarding the floor counting accuracy as i'm yet to test it, and even more so on the sleep tracking abilities of the watch, but its an interesting piece of information. Yet to do an outdoor activity thanks to the pandemic, so can't comment on the GPS tracking ability, but i guess it will do that job pretty well, being a Garmin product. The watch comes with basic smart abilities like controlling music, approve/deny authentication requests, message notifications(whatsapp, messages and such), control music etc. There is a limit to the number of watch faces one can have in the watch, and this can easily be downloaded from the Connect IQ store. The tansflective display is easy on the battery too, and the watch lasts upto 5 days which is pretty good. Downloads to the watch or making changes to the watch faces drains the battery faster, otherwise its pretty much normal.The Connect app is really good and user friendly giving all sorts of metrics regarding the activities we did. None of the banks support Garmin Pay, so can't use it, which doesn't bother me much. Overall, pretty good in its line of work and i believe the upcoming updates will only make it better. Pretty satisfied with its performance and a happy customer. A keeper for sure. Thanks Amazon, peace.

"Garmin Vivoactive 3 GPS Smartwatch, 1.2 inch",Jon Skaehill,N/A,(Still) My FAVORITE watch (over a year later),N/A,"Update: I’ve had this now for over a year and I still absolutely love it. The bands have held up, the watch face protectors I got sincerely save my watch and I’ve only replaced it once!Update: 8 month check in!  I still love it!  It tracks gym work outs, road workouts, yoga and more. I can track my sleep and heart rate when I’m stressed and so much more. Still love it!Original review: I have had this watch for 6 months and I wear it daily.  I absolutely LOVE this watch. I researched for months before purchasing one and I’m so glad I got this one. I previously had a Garmin Forerunner and while it did the job I didn’t love it. Before that I went through FitBit watches left and right.  They definitely are not built to last.  My only regret with the VivoActive is that I didn’t buy a watch base in white, I purchased black.The battery life isn’t awesome. Mine lasts a full 4 days, maybe 5 if I don’t workout as much.  But since I work from home that’s no big deal.  I do have to take the cord with me when I travel. PSA: take off your watch before you go thru security at the airport. It gives me trouble every single time. Phone notifications seem to drain the battery.  I wish I could tell the watch “only give me call, text and amazon delivery notifications.”  But your watch options are to receive all notifications that come to your phone or no notifications.This thing is durable and I purchased different bands that I love. These bands tuck into themselves so there’s no bulk on my wrist. I also purchased a protective film for the glass, but I ordered that one “door frame” too late and got a nick in the glass of my Garmin. The film cover is great and I forget it’s even there. The touchscreen still works just fine with the cover on it.I keep the charging cord in my car. I recharge my watch while driving. It charges pretty quickly.The green heart rate lights can be a little annoying at night. I’m sure there’s a way to turn them off but I haven’t figured it out yet.I also downloaded a different watch face. I like that I can see everything in one place: Time, date, HR, steps, battery life, and it even shows that I have 1 alarm set.I like the app where I can see what all I’ve done on the calendar view. If you don’t synch a few times a week the sync process can a bit. Maybe 5 min at the most for several week’s worth of data.I’m still very pleased with this Garmin. I wear it every single day!

With extreme  work  it is 7hr of life.Old reviewlet me tell you  Previously to this I was not using any tracker/ smartwatch. I am not a pro athlete but yes in a week 3 time I do cycling/Run/Swim.I am wearing it for 7 days before review this Before this, I was looking to buy a product under 10 K only. However, after careful consideration and review, I realized my parameter of judgement should not be money it should be the feature.Accuracy: in term of accuracy YES nothing can beat Garmin product. I used my Samsung A80 phone there was a higher distance of 1 km for every 6/7 KM  however Watch recorded it beautifully. I, not a person who is die-hard of accuracy but since I do a medium level of exercise so I want that to be recorded accurately.battery life; my plan was to use it only when going for any activity so if a product had 3-4 hr of battery it was enough. However later I realized my cycling ride of 100 KM goes beyond 6 hr and it was very much important to record fully and support for 8 hr.weight of the watch: sleep tracking and all daily activity mean you need to wear it 24x 7.So definitely this is important that design-wise it is comfortable and steady as well.rechargeability: very quick under 70 Min it is fully recharged.The display is really good in the day time or sun or night all term visibility even with 10 % brightness.I wear it for bath and washing hand there is no issue with water, even in rain.Final Verdict: tracker or Smartwatch... ??

"Garmin Vivoactive 3 GPS Smartwatch, 1.2 inch",Shantanu Das,5.0,"5.0 out of 5 stars
Almost a perfect smart sports watch with GPS except floor counts",N/A,"I am writing this review after 1 month usuage. 1. Battery backup- Superb. With daily 90 mins GPS usuage, it will run around 3 days. Without GPS, easily it runs for 6~7 days.2. GPS: Nearly perfect tracking but It takes around 2 mins to receive GPS signal in open area.3. Step Counts: No issue, perfect. But if you shake your hands in sitting position, it counts steps wrongly.4. Heart Rate: Monitor continuously, no issue.5. Floor Counts: I am not happy with the floor counts, someday it counts perfectly but most of the days, it counts wrongly, either more or less. For example, today I have climbed 4 times to my 3rd floor office which is 12 floors total but it has counted only 8 floors.6. Water Resistant: I haven’t swim with it but I wash the watch daily after workout in tap water, no issue.7. Charging: Very fast, from 5% to 100% it takes around 75 mins.8. Sleep Analysis: Good with all details analysis like deep sleep, NREM sleep etc.9. Connectivity with Connect app: It sync perfectly with my iphone Connect app and also sync the data with Strava and iphone Health data.10. Visibility: Even in full sunlight, I can see all the data without any issue. At dark, the backlight is perfect at 40% brightness to read all data.11. Notification and Call Receiving or Rejecting: I can see all notification headlines and can accept or reject calls very easily of my iPhone.12. Weight and feeling: Very light weight, doesn’t give me any bad feeling.Overall a good smart sports watch with a decent design and look to wear in formal and casual clothes.

Almost a perfect smart sports watch with GPS except floor counts",N/A,"I am writing this review after 1 month usuage. 1. Battery backup- Superb. With daily 90 mins GPS usuage, it will run around 3 days. Without GPS, easily it runs for 6~7 days.2. GPS: Nearly perfect tracking but It takes around 2 mins to receive GPS signal in open area.3. Step Counts: No issue, perfect. But if you shake your hands in sitting position, it counts steps wrongly.4. Heart Rate: Monitor continuously, no issue.5. Floor Counts: I am not happy with the floor counts, someday it counts perfectly but most of the days, it counts wrongly, either more or less. For example, today I have climbed 4 times to my 3rd floor office which is 12 floors total but it has counted only 8 floors.6. Water Resistant: I haven’t swim with it but I wash the watch daily after workout in tap water, no issue.7. Charging: Very fast, from 5% to 100% it takes around 75 mins.8. Sleep Analysis: Good with all details analysis like deep sleep, NREM sleep etc.9. Connectivity with Connect app: It sync perfectly with my iphone Connect app and also sync the data with Strava and iphone Health data.10. Visibility: Even in full sunlight, I can see all the data without any issue. At dark, the backlight is perfect at 40% brightness to read all data.11. Notification and Call Receiving or Rejecting: I can see all notification headlines and can accept or reject calls very easily of my iPhone.12. Weight and feeling: Very light weight, doesn’t give me any bad feeling.Overall a good smart sports watch with a decent design and look to wear in formal and casual clothes.

"Garmin Vivoactive 3 GPS Smartwatch, 1.2 inch",Sreekanth S,4.0,"4.0 out of 5 stars
Great fitness tracker with basic smart abilities.",N/A,"Bought it during this festive season, been using it since 19th. It took a day more for Amazon to deliver it than promised, but it arrived sealed and intact. In the box you will find the watch, 3 stickers, charger and the manual. The smartwatch charges quick, even through USB port power. One will have to download 3 apps. Garmin Connect for metrics, Garmin pay and device settings, Garmin Connect IQ for downloading custom watch faces and Garmin Express on the laptop for registration, firmware and map updates and such. Setting this up was easy and the watch was up and ready to go in no time.Coming to the watch, for most of us who are used to high quality, high refresh rate AMOLED displays, the transflective low resolution display can be a bummer, however the upside is that the display is extremely easy to read in sunlight and outdoors and it will grow on you gradually. A press on the button from the main screen takes you to the preloaded work outs screen whereas a long press on the same will take you to the settings(power, GPS, brightness etc). You can swipe up or down to access the widgets or one can use the haptic touch slider on the left hand side to scroll, though the latter can be a hit or miss. At times the watch might take a moment to catch its breath, but its been running smooth so far. Step tracking and HR monitoring is excellent, and one can customize the preloaded workouts according to their style. Not so sure regarding the floor counting accuracy as i'm yet to test it, and even more so on the sleep tracking abilities of the watch, but its an interesting piece of information. Yet to do an outdoor activity thanks to the pandemic, so can't comment on the GPS tracking ability, but i guess it will do that job pretty well, being a Garmin product. The watch comes with basic smart abilities like controlling music, approve/deny authentication requests, message notifications(whatsapp, messages and such), control music etc. There is a limit to the number of watch faces one can have in the watch, and this can easily be downloaded from the Connect IQ store. The tansflective display is easy on the battery too, and the watch lasts upto 5 days which is pretty good. Downloads to the watch or making changes to the watch faces drains the battery faster, otherwise its pretty much normal.The Connect app is really good and user friendly giving all sorts of metrics regarding the activities we did. None of the banks support Garmin Pay, so can't use it, which doesn't bother me much. Overall, pretty good in its line of work and i believe the upcoming updates will only make it better. Pretty satisfied with its performance and a happy customer. A keeper for sure. Thanks Amazon, peace.

"Garmin Vivoactive 3 GPS Smartwatch, 1.2 inch",Jon Skaehill,N/A,(Still) My FAVORITE watch (over a year later),N/A,"Update: I’ve had this now for over a year and I still absolutely love it. The bands have held up, the watch face protectors I got sincerely save my watch and I’ve only replaced it once!Update: 8 month check in!  I still love it!  It tracks gym work outs, road workouts, yoga and more. I can track my sleep and heart rate when I’m stressed and so much more. Still love it!Original review: I have had this watch for 6 months and I wear it daily.  I absolutely LOVE this watch. I researched for months before purchasing one and I’m so glad I got this one. I previously had a Garmin Forerunner and while it did the job I didn’t love it. Before that I went through FitBit watches left and right.  They definitely are not built to last.  My only regret with the VivoActive is that I didn’t buy a watch base in white, I purchased black.The battery life isn’t awesome. Mine lasts a full 4 days, maybe 5 if I don’t workout as much.  But since I work from home that’s no big deal.  I do have to take the cord with me when I travel. PSA: take off your watch before you go thru security at the airport. It gives me trouble every single time. Phone notifications seem to drain the battery.  I wish I could tell the watch “only give me call, text and amazon delivery notifications.”  But your watch options are to receive all notifications that come to your phone or no notifications.This thing is durable and I purchased different bands that I love. These bands tuck into themselves so there’s no bulk on my wrist. I also purchased a protective film for the glass, but I ordered that one “door frame” too late and got a nick in the glass of my Garmin. The film cover is great and I forget it’s even there. The touchscreen still works just fine with the cover on it.I keep the charging cord in my car. I recharge my watch while driving. It charges pretty quickly.The green heart rate lights can be a little annoying at night. I’m sure there’s a way to turn them off but I haven’t figured it out yet.I also downloaded a different watch face. I like that I can see everything in one place: Time, date, HR, steps, battery life, and it even shows that I have 1 alarm set.I like the app where I can see what all I’ve done on the calendar view. If you don’t synch a few times a week the sync process can a bit. Maybe 5 min at the most for several week’s worth of data.I’m still very pleased with this Garmin. I wear it every single day!

Nice Product !!",N/A,"Update on 24 oct 2022 : still using it and work as good ot was woth slight degrade in battery  but that is OK. I use  every  where  fro. Household work or swimming  ,biking,  running,2 thing i left it is missing  is  mutli  sport option like running and cycling. And battrey likfe is now3 day . With extreme  work  it is 7hr of life.Old reviewlet me tell you  Previously to this I was not using any tracker/ smartwatch. I am not a pro athlete but yes in a week 3 time I do cycling/Run/Swim.I am wearing it for 7 days before review this Before this, I was looking to buy a product under 10 K only. However, after careful consideration and review, I realized my parameter of judgement should not be money it should be the feature.Accuracy: in term of accuracy YES nothing can beat Garmin product. I used my Samsung A80 phone there was a higher distance of 1 km for every 6/7 KM  however Watch recorded it beautifully. I, not a person who is die-hard of accuracy but since I do a medium level of exercise so I want that to be recorded accurately.battery life; my plan was to use it only when going for any activity so if a product had 3-4 hr of battery it was enough. However later I realized my cycling ride of 100 KM goes beyond 6 hr and it was very much important to record fully and support for 8 hr.weight of the watch: sleep tracking and all daily activity mean you need to wear it 24x 7.So definitely this is important that design-wise it is comfortable and steady as well.rechargeability: very quick under 70 Min it is fully recharged.The display is really good in the day time or sun or night all term visibility even with 10 % brightness.I wear it for bath and washing hand there is no issue with water, even in rain.Final Verdict: tracker or Smartwatch... ?? Well, Gramin product is a tracker which can also be used as a watch. This is surely a costly product but surely worth buying for a longer-term. Steady, robust and accurate.

I am not a pro athlete but yes in a week 3 time I do cycling/Run/Swim.I am wearing it for 7 days before review this Before this, I was looking to buy a product under 10 K only. However, after careful consideration and review, I realized my parameter of judgement should not be money it should be the feature.Accuracy: in term of accuracy YES nothing can beat Garmin product. I used my Samsung A80 phone there was a higher distance of 1 km for every 6/7 KM  however Watch recorded it beautifully. I, not a person who is die-hard of accuracy but since I do a medium level of exercise so I want that to be recorded accurately.battery life; my plan was to use it only when going for any activity so if a product had 3-4 hr of battery it was enough. However later I realized my cycling ride of 100 KM goes beyond 6 hr and it was very much important to record fully and support for 8 hr.weight of the watch: sleep tracking and all daily activity mean you need to wear it 24x 7.So definitely this is important that design-wise it is comfortable and steady as well.rechargeability: very quick under 70 Min it is fully recharged.The display is really good in the day time or sun or night all term visibility even with 10 % brightness.I wear it for bath and washing hand there is no issue with water, even in rain.Final Verdict: tracker or Smartwatch... ?? Well, Gramin product is a tracker which can also be used as a watch. This is surely a costly product but surely worth buying for a longer-term. Steady, robust and accurate.

"Garmin Vivoactive 3 GPS Smartwatch, 1.2 inch",Shantanu Das,5.0,"5.0 out of 5 stars
Almost a perfect smart sports watch with GPS except floor counts",N/A,"I am writing this review after 1 month usuage. 1. Battery backup- Superb. With daily 90 mins GPS usuage, it will run around 3 days. Without GPS, easily it runs for 6~7 days.2. GPS: Nearly perfect tracking but It takes around 2 mins to receive GPS signal in open area.3. Step Counts: No issue, perfect. But if you shake your hands in sitting position, it counts steps wrongly.4. Heart Rate: Monitor continuously, no issue.5. Floor Counts: I am not happy with the floor counts, someday it counts perfectly but most of the days, it counts wrongly, either more or less. For example, today I have climbed 4 times to my 3rd floor office which is 12 floors total but it has counted only 8 floors.6. Water Resistant: I haven’t swim with it but I wash the watch daily after workout in tap water, no issue.7. Charging: Very fast, from 5% to 100% it takes around 75 mins.8. Sleep Analysis: Good with all details analysis like deep sleep, NREM sleep etc.9. Connectivity with Connect app: It sync perfectly with my iphone Connect app and also sync the data with Strava and iphone Health data.10. Visibility: Even in full sunlight, I can see all the data without any issue. At dark, the backlight is perfect at 40% brightness to read all data.11. Notification and Call Receiving or Rejecting: I can see all notification headlines and can accept or reject calls very easily of my iPhone.12. Weight and feeling: Very light weight, doesn’t give me any bad feeling.Overall a good smart sports watch with a decent design and look to wear in formal and casual clothes.

"Garmin Vivoactive 3 GPS Smartwatch, 1.2 inch",Sreekanth S,4.0,"4.0 out of 5 stars
Great fitness tracker with basic smart abilities.",N/A,"Bought it during this festive season, been using it since 19th. It took a day more for Amazon to deliver it than promised, but it arrived sealed and intact. In the box you will find the watch, 3 stickers, charger and the manual. The smartwatch charges quick, even through USB port power. One will have to download 3 apps. Garmin Connect for metrics, Garmin pay and device settings, Garmin Connect IQ for downloading custom watch faces and Garmin Express on the laptop for registration, firmware and map updates and such. Setting this up was easy and the watch was up and ready to go in no time.Coming to the watch, for most of us who are used to high quality, high refresh rate AMOLED displays, the transflective low resolution display can be a bummer, however the upside is that the display is extremely easy to read in sunlight and outdoors and it will grow on you gradually. A press on the button from the main screen takes you to the preloaded work outs screen whereas a long press on the same will take you to the settings(power, GPS, brightness etc). You can swipe up or down to access the widgets or one can use the haptic touch slider on the left hand side to scroll, though the latter can be a hit or miss. At times the watch might take a moment to catch its breath, but its been running smooth so far. Step tracking and HR monitoring is excellent, and one can customize the preloaded workouts according to their style. Not so sure regarding the floor counting accuracy as i'm yet to test it, and even more so on the sleep tracking abilities of the watch, but its an interesting piece of information. Yet to do an outdoor activity thanks to the pandemic, so can't comment on the GPS tracking ability, but i guess it will do that job pretty well, being a Garmin product. The watch comes with basic smart abilities like controlling music, approve/deny authentication requests, message notifications(whatsapp, messages and such), control music etc. There is a limit to the number of watch faces one can have in the watch, and this can easily be downloaded from the Connect IQ store. The tansflective display is easy on the battery too, and the watch lasts upto 5 days which is pretty good. Downloads to the watch or making changes to the watch faces drains the battery faster, otherwise its pretty much normal.The Connect app is really good and user friendly giving all sorts of metrics regarding the activities we did. None of the banks support Garmin Pay, so can't use it, which doesn't bother me much. Overall, pretty good in its line of work and i believe the upcoming updates will only make it better. Pretty satisfied with its performance and a happy customer. A keeper for sure. Thanks Amazon, peace.

"Garmin Vivoactive 3 GPS Smartwatch, 1.2 inch",Jon Skaehill,N/A,(Still) My FAVORITE watch (over a year later),N/A,"Update: I’ve had this now for over a year and I still absolutely love it. The bands have held up, the watch face protectors I got sincerely save my watch and I’ve only replaced it once!Update: 8 month check in!  I still love it!  It tracks gym work outs, road workouts, yoga and more. I can track my sleep and heart rate when I’m stressed and so much more. Still love it!Original review: I have had this watch for 6 months and I wear it daily.  I absolutely LOVE this watch. I researched for months before purchasing one and I’m so glad I got this one. I previously had a Garmin Forerunner and while it did the job I didn’t love it. Before that I went through FitBit watches left and right.  They definitely are not built to last.  My only regret with the VivoActive is that I didn’t buy a watch base in white, I purchased black.The battery life isn’t awesome. Mine lasts a full 4 days, maybe 5 if I don’t workout as much.  But since I work from home that’s no big deal.  I do have to take the cord with me when I travel. PSA: take off your watch before you go thru security at the airport. It gives me trouble every single time. Phone notifications seem to drain the battery.  I wish I could tell the watch “only give me call, text and amazon delivery notifications.”  But your watch options are to receive all notifications that come to your phone or no notifications.This thing is durable and I purchased different bands that I love. These bands tuck into themselves so there’s no bulk on my wrist. I also purchased a protective film for the glass, but I ordered that one “door frame” too late and got a nick in the glass of my Garmin. The film cover is great and I forget it’s even there. The touchscreen still works just fine with the cover on it.I keep the charging cord in my car. I recharge my watch while driving. It charges pretty quickly.The green heart rate lights can be a little annoying at night. I’m sure there’s a way to turn them off but I haven’t figured it out yet.I also downloaded a different watch face. I like that I can see everything in one place: Time, date, HR, steps, battery life, and it even shows that I have 1 alarm set.I like the app where I can see what all I’ve done on the calendar view. If you don’t synch a few times a week the sync process can a bit. Maybe 5 min at the most for several week’s worth of data.I’m still very pleased with this Garmin. I wear it every single day!

"Garmin Forerunner 55, GPS Running Watch with Daily Suggested Workouts, Up to 2 Weeks of Battery Life (Whitestone)",Tom Van Deusen,N/A,A fantastic watch for runners,N/A,"I never owned a smart watch, and didn't really want any more devices in my life, but as an avid runner I wanted a way to track my runs without having a phone in my hand. I was originally looking at fitbits but was totally turned off by the subscription model they use for their app. I did a little more research and found out about this Garmin.This watch ticks all the boxes for me, and I'm very happy with my purchase. I actually like the non-backlit screen (with a button for backlight) that's always on and reflects well under even low light. The GPS is exremely accurate, and even charted the fastest parts of my runs geographically. The app is FANTASTIC, it charts absolutely everything and breaks down every stat under the sun (also comes free with the watch, no subscription for all its features). It syncs with my Strava automatically to share runs with friends. I like that it isn't touch screen so I can feel the buttons to stop and start at lights, and it has a nice buzz to let me know when I do that.I didn't want another ""smart"" device in my life, but this one is just limited enough for me. I don't have to take calls into my wrist like James Bond, or tap away on a tiny screen. I get email and text notifications which is surprisingly handy, so I'm taking my phone out less for less urgent things (which inevitably leads me to fiddling with other apps). I also use it as an alarm in the morning, it works great. It doesn't get in the way, and it does absolutely everything I needed it to do. I got the white one and it looks pretty nice, too. Highly recommend for runners, couldn't be happier.

"Garmin Forerunner 55, GPS Running Watch with Daily Suggested Workouts, Up to 2 Weeks of Battery Life (Whitestone)",Tom Van Deusen,N/A,A fantastic watch for runners,N/A,"I never owned a smart watch, and didn't really want any more devices in my life, but as an avid runner I wanted a way to track my runs without having a phone in my hand. I was originally looking at fitbits but was totally turned off by the subscription model they use for their app. I did a little more research and found out about this Garmin.This watch ticks all the boxes for me, and I'm very happy with my purchase. I actually like the non-backlit screen (with a button for backlight) that's always on and reflects well under even low light. The GPS is exremely accurate, and even charted the fastest parts of my runs geographically. The app is FANTASTIC, it charts absolutely everything and breaks down every stat under the sun (also comes free with the watch, no subscription for all its features). It syncs with my Strava automatically to share runs with friends. I like that it isn't touch screen so I can feel the buttons to stop and start at lights, and it has a nice buzz to let me know when I do that.I didn't want another ""smart"" device in my life, but this one is just limited enough for me. I don't have to take calls into my wrist like James Bond, or tap away on a tiny screen. I get email and text notifications which is surprisingly handy, so I'm taking my phone out less for less urgent things (which inevitably leads me to fiddling with other apps). I also use it as an alarm in the morning, it works great. It doesn't get in the way, and it does absolutely everything I needed it to do. I got the white one and it looks pretty nice, too. Highly recommend for runners, couldn't be happier.

"Garmin Forerunner 55, GPS Running Watch with Daily Suggested Workouts, Up to 2 Weeks of Battery Life (Whitestone)",Tom Van Deusen,N/A,A fantastic watch for runners,N/A,"I never owned a smart watch, and didn't really want any more devices in my life, but as an avid runner I wanted a way to track my runs without having a phone in my hand. I was originally looking at fitbits but was totally turned off by the subscription model they use for their app. I did a little more research and found out about this Garmin.This watch ticks all the boxes for me, and I'm very happy with my purchase. I actually like the non-backlit screen (with a button for backlight) that's always on and reflects well under even low light. The GPS is exremely accurate, and even charted the fastest parts of my runs geographically. The app is FANTASTIC, it charts absolutely everything and breaks down every stat under the sun (also comes free with the watch, no subscription for all its features). It syncs with my Strava automatically to share runs with friends. I like that it isn't touch screen so I can feel the buttons to stop and start at lights, and it has a nice buzz to let me know when I do that.I didn't want another ""smart"" device in my life, but this one is just limited enough for me. I don't have to take calls into my wrist like James Bond, or tap away on a tiny screen. I get email and text notifications which is surprisingly handy, so I'm taking my phone out less for less urgent things (which inevitably leads me to fiddling with other apps). I also use it as an alarm in the morning, it works great. It doesn't get in the way, and it does absolutely everything I needed it to do. I got the white one and it looks pretty nice, too. Highly recommend for runners, couldn't be happier.

"Garmin Forerunner 55, GPS Running Watch with Daily Suggested Workouts, Up to 2 Weeks of Battery Life (Whitestone)",Tom Van Deusen,N/A,A fantastic watch for runners,N/A,"I never owned a smart watch, and didn't really want any more devices in my life, but as an avid runner I wanted a way to track my runs without having a phone in my hand. I was originally looking at fitbits but was totally turned off by the subscription model they use for their app. I did a little more research and found out about this Garmin.This watch ticks all the boxes for me, and I'm very happy with my purchase. I actually like the non-backlit screen (with a button for backlight) that's always on and reflects well under even low light. The GPS is exremely accurate, and even charted the fastest parts of my runs geographically. The app is FANTASTIC, it charts absolutely everything and breaks down every stat under the sun (also comes free with the watch, no subscription for all its features). It syncs with my Strava automatically to share runs with friends. I like that it isn't touch screen so I can feel the buttons to stop and start at lights, and it has a nice buzz to let me know when I do that.I didn't want another ""smart"" device in my life, but this one is just limited enough for me. I don't have to take calls into my wrist like James Bond, or tap away on a tiny screen. I get email and text notifications which is surprisingly handy, so I'm taking my phone out less for less urgent things (which inevitably leads me to fiddling with other apps). I also use it as an alarm in the morning, it works great. It doesn't get in the way, and it does absolutely everything I needed it to do. I got the white one and it looks pretty nice, too. Highly recommend for runners, couldn't be happier.

"Garmin Forerunner 55, GPS Running Watch with Daily Suggested Workouts, Up to 2 Weeks of Battery Life (Whitestone)",Tom Van Deusen,N/A,A fantastic watch for runners,N/A,"I never owned a smart watch, and didn't really want any more devices in my life, but as an avid runner I wanted a way to track my runs without having a phone in my hand. I was originally looking at fitbits but was totally turned off by the subscription model they use for their app. I did a little more research and found out about this Garmin.This watch ticks all the boxes for me, and I'm very happy with my purchase. I actually like the non-backlit screen (with a button for backlight) that's always on and reflects well under even low light. The GPS is exremely accurate, and even charted the fastest parts of my runs geographically. The app is FANTASTIC, it charts absolutely everything and breaks down every stat under the sun (also comes free with the watch, no subscription for all its features). It syncs with my Strava automatically to share runs with friends. I like that it isn't touch screen so I can feel the buttons to stop and start at lights, and it has a nice buzz to let me know when I do that.I didn't want another ""smart"" device in my life, but this one is just limited enough for me. I don't have to take calls into my wrist like James Bond, or tap away on a tiny screen. I get email and text notifications which is surprisingly handy, so I'm taking my phone out less for less urgent things (which inevitably leads me to fiddling with other apps). I also use it as an alarm in the morning, it works great. It doesn't get in the way, and it does absolutely everything I needed it to do. I got the white one and it looks pretty nice, too. Highly recommend for runners, couldn't be happier.

"Garmin Forerunner 55, GPS Running Watch with Daily Suggested Workouts, Up to 2 Weeks of Battery Life (Whitestone)",Tom Van Deusen,N/A,A fantastic watch for runners,N/A,"I never owned a smart watch, and didn't really want any more devices in my life, but as an avid runner I wanted a way to track my runs without having a phone in my hand. I was originally looking at fitbits but was totally turned off by the subscription model they use for their app. I did a little more research and found out about this Garmin.This watch ticks all the boxes for me, and I'm very happy with my purchase. I actually like the non-backlit screen (with a button for backlight) that's always on and reflects well under even low light. The GPS is exremely accurate, and even charted the fastest parts of my runs geographically. The app is FANTASTIC, it charts absolutely everything and breaks down every stat under the sun (also comes free with the watch, no subscription for all its features). It syncs with my Strava automatically to share runs with friends. I like that it isn't touch screen so I can feel the buttons to stop and start at lights, and it has a nice buzz to let me know when I do that.I didn't want another ""smart"" device in my life, but this one is just limited enough for me. I don't have to take calls into my wrist like James Bond, or tap away on a tiny screen. I get email and text notifications which is surprisingly handy, so I'm taking my phone out less for less urgent things (which inevitably leads me to fiddling with other apps). I also use it as an alarm in the morning, it works great. It doesn't get in the way, and it does absolutely everything I needed it to do. I got the white one and it looks pretty nice, too. Highly recommend for runners, couldn't be happier.

"Garmin Forerunner 55, GPS Running Watch with Daily Suggested Workouts, Up to 2 Weeks of Battery Life (Whitestone)",Tom Van Deusen,N/A,A fantastic watch for runners,N/A,"I never owned a smart watch, and didn't really want any more devices in my life, but as an avid runner I wanted a way to track my runs without having a phone in my hand. I was originally looking at fitbits but was totally turned off by the subscription model they use for their app. I did a little more research and found out about this Garmin.This watch ticks all the boxes for me, and I'm very happy with my purchase. I actually like the non-backlit screen (with a button for backlight) that's always on and reflects well under even low light. The GPS is exremely accurate, and even charted the fastest parts of my runs geographically. The app is FANTASTIC, it charts absolutely everything and breaks down every stat under the sun (also comes free with the watch, no subscription for all its features). It syncs with my Strava automatically to share runs with friends. I like that it isn't touch screen so I can feel the buttons to stop and start at lights, and it has a nice buzz to let me know when I do that.I didn't want another ""smart"" device in my life, but this one is just limited enough for me. I don't have to take calls into my wrist like James Bond, or tap away on a tiny screen. I get email and text notifications which is surprisingly handy, so I'm taking my phone out less for less urgent things (which inevitably leads me to fiddling with other apps). I also use it as an alarm in the morning, it works great. It doesn't get in the way, and it does absolutely everything I needed it to do. I got the white one and it looks pretty nice, too. Highly recommend for runners, couldn't be happier.

It also has different activity modes like running, biking and treadmill.

Even with the Bluetooth, i have to connect it regularly.- Way too many apps to be downloaded for various functions to work and once you start using those functions i doubt it'll make it even 8hours.The only good thing I saw was that of course the looks. Fossil watches are known for their design and this no doubt is beautiful and the second thing is the in-built microphone to receive calls.

Even with the Bluetooth, i have to connect it regularly.- Way too many apps to be downloaded for various functions to work and once you start using those functions i doubt it'll make it even 8hours.The only good thing I saw was that of course the looks. Fossil watches are known for their design and this no doubt is beautiful and the second thing is the in-built microphone to receive calls.

That's totally unworthy at the price segment.I haven't tested it yet for 3ATM water resistance but the watch functions well in rains. The calling feature is also good however, at times, I get notified only when the call has almost died.Another thing that bothers me, that after turning on the extended mode all the settings are changed to save battery but when the phone re-enters normal mode (daily mode), you need to change each & every settings again like gesture controls, connections.

Dissapointed",N/A,"So this is my 6th Fossil Watch however, the first fossil smartwatch. I have Fossil Hybrid too and i think it's better than the smartwatch.- Battery life, as all the reviews says, is truly the major problem. I have been using it without any wifi connection and other apps, but still the battery barely makes it 24hours.- Connectivity is not good. Even with the Bluetooth, i have to connect it regularly.- Way too many apps to be downloaded for various functions to work and once you start using those functions i doubt it'll make it even 8hours.The only good thing I saw was that of course the looks. Fossil watches are known for their design and this no doubt is beautiful and the second thing is the in-built microphone to receive calls. Apart from that, the upgrade still hasn't happened of the wear os. I don't know how they'll survive the market with this cost for their smartwatches.

Dissapointed",N/A,"So this is my 6th Fossil Watch however, the first fossil smartwatch. I have Fossil Hybrid too and i think it's better than the smartwatch.- Battery life, as all the reviews says, is truly the major problem. I have been using it without any wifi connection and other apps, but still the battery barely makes it 24hours.- Connectivity is not good. Even with the Bluetooth, i have to connect it regularly.- Way too many apps to be downloaded for various functions to work and once you start using those functions i doubt it'll make it even 8hours.The only good thing I saw was that of course the looks. Fossil watches are known for their design and this no doubt is beautiful and the second thing is the in-built microphone to receive calls. Apart from that, the upgrade still hasn't happened of the wear os. I don't know how they'll survive the market with this cost for their smartwatches.

But if you are an ios user and don’t wanna spend that much time on an apple watch and wanna have something close to the Galaxy Watch 4, This is the watch for you, it has everything you could ask for but the with a drawback of Battery life. The Battery Sucks Fossil claims 48 Hours which is laughable and a very big lie this watch can last a max of 12 hours on normal usage. But if this aint an issue for you and you get this watch near to 14 Thousand It is a Very great option for you.

Upgraded to this and very happy with the 6. Great if you can get for the right price. Batter can last between 1 day and many depending on usage. But you will need to charge daily (like most phones.)

Over-priced & under-performing in the segment",N/A,"The watch looks elegant however when it comes to performance the watch isn't that effective to the price.The watch lags very often & the battery is questionable. On a full charge, with settings like AOD, gestures, Bluetooth & Wi-Fi on, & with no usage, the battery doesn't lasts 12 hours. That's totally unworthy at the price segment.I haven't tested it yet for 3ATM water resistance but the watch functions well in rains. The calling feature is also good however, at times, I get notified only when the call has almost died.Another thing that bothers me, that after turning on the extended mode all the settings are changed to save battery but when the phone re-enters normal mode (daily mode), you need to change each & every settings again like gesture controls, connections. This is the most annoying thing for a watch priced at ₹24000.I would surely not recommend people Gen 6 for the performance.'v'

Dissapointed",N/A,"So this is my 6th Fossil Watch however, the first fossil smartwatch. I have Fossil Hybrid too and i think it's better than the smartwatch.- Battery life, as all the reviews says, is truly the major problem. I have been using it without any wifi connection and other apps, but still the battery barely makes it 24hours.- Connectivity is not good. Even with the Bluetooth, i have to connect it regularly.- Way too many apps to be downloaded for various functions to work and once you start using those functions i doubt it'll make it even 8hours.The only good thing I saw was that of course the looks. Fossil watches are known for their design and this no doubt is beautiful and the second thing is the in-built microphone to receive calls. Apart from that, the upgrade still hasn't happened of the wear os. I don't know how they'll survive the market with this cost for their smartwatches.

Nice one 👍",N/A,"This is my First Smart watch.Merits :-Performance is very good, Since this has Snapdragon 4100+.Ram is 1Gb but it is fine.Internal Storage is 8gb.After wear Os update Android version of watch is 11.2 and UI is Good.Overall the watch is good for me.Demerits:-Battery life is not really good ,but because  they gave snapdragon 4100 + processor it consumes more battery.Overall performance wise good 👍Battery life is very bad ,Fossil need to work on this 👎To maximize the battery life of your watch,try the solutions below.Let your screen turn off.You can set the display to turn off when not in use, rather than always show the time. ...Try a different watch face. ...Adjust screen brightness. ...Turn off notifications you don't want. ...Uninstall apps. ...Check battery life & usage.
